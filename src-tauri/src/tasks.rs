//! `tmm task` — background tasks as tmux windows. See
//! `docs/design-docs/features/tmm-cli.md`.
//!
//! LOCAL ONLY: nothing here touches the network. `tmm task *` works with no
//! tmux-mobile server running, which is the whole point — the thing an agent
//! most often wants to background *is* the server.
//!
//! Design contract (load-bearing, all three verified on tmux 3.7b):
//! - `remain-on-exit on` is what makes a task observable after it ends: the
//!   pane goes `#{pane_dead}=1` with the exit code in `#{pane_dead_status}`,
//!   and the scrollback stays readable. So status and log retention come from
//!   ONE native mechanism — no pidfiles, no sentinel files, no log files.
//! - It MUST be set with `-w` (window scope). Session scope would turn it on
//!   for every window the user has open in that session, so their shells would
//!   stop closing on exit. That is not ours to change.
//! - The registry is the `@tmm_task` window option, not a file: one
//!   `list-windows -a` call enumerates every task in every session. An agent
//!   whose context was compacted can rediscover what it left running, which a
//!   remembered PID can never do. `@tmm_cmd` / `@tmm_started` ride along so
//!   `list` needs no second lookup.
//!
//! Task names are GLOBALLY unique (the name is the handle an agent holds), so
//! lookups scan all sessions rather than just the current one.
//!
//! Retention is BOUNDED (board #206, owner 2026-09-20: "任务结束后窗口仍保留；停止任务
//! 也不等于删除窗口，这样就导致大量冗余窗口堆积" — 39 of 40 task windows on the live
//! server were dead, the oldest 7 days). A finished task's window lives
//! `TTL` (30 min, `TMM_TASK_TTL_SECS` overrides) past `#{pane_dead_time}` —
//! the epoch second of the LATEST death, empty while the pane is alive again
//! after a respawn (verified on tmux 3.6a) — and every `tmm task` verb reaps
//! what has expired at its door: one mechanism, local, no daemon, no timer, no
//! file, working with the server down. `stop` closes the window once the
//! process is dead (after printing the last lines), `--keep` retains it.
