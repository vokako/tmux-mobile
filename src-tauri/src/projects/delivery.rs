//! Typing a chat line into an agent's pane — the ONE path every delivery
//! takes (`@name` mentions, board notices, `[reply]` returns, typed briefs).
//!
//! Board #257 (owner, 2026-09-28: "kiro 有堆积未处理消息时，可以合并投递，保持
//! 效率高效"): a queue-mode agent that is mid-turn used to receive every line
//! as its own queued prompt — its own turn, its own full reply — so a burst of
//! 20 lines was 20 turns, and on 2026-09-27 builder's median delivery lag was
//! ~19.5 min (temp/stall-analysis.md). Now, while such a window's turn is open
//! (`telemetry::turn_busy`, derived from turn edges), a line is HELD: a row in
//! the one deliveries table, persisted, not typed. At the turn's end the held
//! lines are typed as ONE prompt — each line intact with its stamp, in order —
//! and the #249 echo match settles them all from that one submission.
//! Delivery is still typing into a pane (non-negotiable 12), later and
//! combined. An idle target, a steer-mode agent and every backend without a
//! queue/steer switch are typed at once, as before.
//!
//! Every decision and every typing for a window runs under one per-window
//! lock, so a line is never typed twice and a stop that lands between "is it
//! busy?" and "hold it" still finds the row.
