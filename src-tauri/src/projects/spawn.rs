//! Spawn a registry agent into a project: materialize its ISOLATED home from
//! the registry definition, open a tmux window in the project's session, and
//! launch the backend CLI wired to `tmm`.
//!
//! Two agents-v2 principles land here (docs/exec-plans/agents-v2.md §1):
//!
//! - **Home isolation** (principle 5): everything the agent runs with —
//!   persona, skills, MCP servers, hooks — is rendered into
//!   `<workspace>/.tmm/agents/<name>/` and selected via the backend's home
//!   env var (`KIRO_HOME` / `CODEX_HOME`) or config flags (claude). The
//!   user's global CLI config never leaks in, so the same registry definition
//!   behaves identically in every project.
//! - **CLI-only substrate** (principle 2): NO team MCP server, NO heartbeat
//!   machinery. The agent talks through `tmm` (one paragraph in its system
//!   prompt) and we observe it through the notify/telemetry hooks that are
//!   part of the rendered home.
//!
//! The per-backend rendering deliberately mirrors `team/backends.rs` (same
//! file formats, same flags, same 2KB-launch-line lesson via
//! `write_launch_script`) minus the team plumbing. Team stays untouched and
//! becomes legacy in Phase C.

         - Use `tmm log --limit 50` for recent messages, `tmm log --grep <text> [--global]` to search history, and `tmm agent list` for participants. Read a queued backlog in full before replying once; when context is unclear, check the log or ask the relevant person.\n\
