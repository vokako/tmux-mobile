//! The scratch terminal's session (board #324, owner 2026-10-09: "这个
//! Terminal 只是临时用的，并且跟你的项目没有关系，我就是单纯想在系统上去运行个
//! Terminal").
//!
//! Every tmux session is a project (`auto_adopt_once`), except ONE: the
//! session the desktop's scratch panel opens. What makes a session that one
//! is OWNERSHIP, never the name alone — `owned` is the single predicate every
//! path asks (ensure, kill, auto-adopt):
//!
//! - the session `tmm-scratch` exists (exact target),
//! - it carries our mark, the tmux session option `@tmm-scratch` = `1`, set
//!   when we created it (a native tmux fact: no new store, gone with the
//!   session),
//! - and no project row declares that session (a project that is down still
//!   holds its name).
//!
//! A name held by anything else — a plain session the user made, or a
//! project — is `Taken`: we refuse with the reason and never kill, rename or
//! undeclare it. The session starts in `$HOME` with the default shell, runs
//! no agent and installs no hooks beyond its own keep-alive.
//!
//! Two things make it the owner's "hidden quick terminal" rather than just
//! another session (board #326, owner 2026-10-09: "不需要作为一个真实的
//! project 显示出来，就是一个隐藏的会话就好…退出这个隐藏会话时，也不要关掉"):
//!
//! - **Hidden from every listing.** `hidden_session()` — derived from the one
//!   `owned` predicate, never from the name — is the session the session/pane
//!   listings drop (`server/rpc.rs`). The panel is its only door.
//! - **Exiting the shell does not end it.** tmux's own mechanism, not a
//!   process manager of ours: `remain-on-exit` keeps the pane when its shell
//!   exits, and the session's `pane-died` hook respawns it IN PLACE, so the
//!   `session:window.pane` target the Terminal subscribes stays valid.
