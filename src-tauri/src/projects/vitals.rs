//! What the agent's own status line already says.
//!
//! An agent CLI paints a status line at the bottom of its pane — the model it is
//! on, how much of the context it has used, its reasoning effort, its cwd and
//! branch. We were showing none of it, while asking the owner to read it in the
//! terminal ("从输出的最后几行原始文本内容 加一下当前状态的嗅探，比如模型名 上下文
//! 长度 effort 之类的", 2026-08-19).
//!
//! Most CLIs expose no live-state API: their own process owns the footer, so we
//! read the LAST FEW LINES of the pane. Claude is the useful exception in the
//! input half: its official `statusLine` command receives exact JSON, which our
//! local `tmm claude-statusline` renders back into one uniquely anchored pane
//! row; the server still observes that row through the same sniffer pipeline.
//! Every field remains optional, an unreadable line yields `Vitals::default()`
//! and NEVER an error, and nothing downstream may assume a value is present.
//!
//! kiro's layout is documented by its own source: the status line is a fixed
//! order of segments joined by `·` —
//! `agent · autonomous · model · effort · context · tangent · codeIntel · goal`
//! on the left, `location · branch` on the right — and the context segment is
//! "Share of the context used" (a pie glyph plus `N%`, or `N% ctx` in lite mode).
//! We anchor on the AGENT NAME, which the caller already knows (a managed agent's
//! window name is its `--agent` name), and read the segments that follow it. When
//! the pane is too narrow the right-hand segments wrap onto their own lines, so
//! every line of the tail is parsed and the first reading of each field wins.

/// A reading of an agent's status line. Every field is a maybe: this is sniffed.
