# Watch-and-supervise loop for the headless WS server.
#
# Why this exists instead of `tauri dev --release`: this host has no
# webkit2gtk-4.1 and no DISPLAY (verified 2026-08-18), so the Tauri shell
# cannot even build here — the headless `--no-default-features` path is the
# supported one (see AGENTS.md "Headless build"). What `tauri dev` would have
# provided for the server half is exactly what this loop does:
#
#   1. build the release server, run it,
#   2. restart it when it EXITS (crash or clean), 2s backoff,
#   3. rebuild when Rust SOURCES CHANGE (mtime poll — no inotify dependency,
#      NFS-safe; measured 4ms per scan over 46 files, so the 3s poll is a
#      ~0.1% duty cycle),
#   4. restart ONLY when the rebuilt binary's bytes actually differ. cargo
#      fingerprints by mtime, so `touch`, a git checkout, or a comment-only
#      edit can relink an identical binary — restarting the server for that
#      would drop every client for nothing,
#   5. debounce: a change is acted on only after the tree has been quiet for
#      one poll interval (a checkout writes files for several seconds), and
#   6. a failed rebuild keeps the last good binary running; retry next change.
#
# Run under `tmm task` so the log and state survive in a tmux window:
#   tmm task start server --replace -- scripts/dev-server-watch.sh
