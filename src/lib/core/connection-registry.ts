// The lifetime of connection objects, and nothing else (board #335 ①).
//
// A registry hands out one Connection + its bound API per key and keeps them
// alive until someone removes them. What it deliberately does NOT do:
//
//   - dial. `ensure` builds an idle object; connecting is the caller's verb,
//     because only the caller knows the address, the token and whether now is
//     the right moment.
//   - decide identity. A key is whatever the layer above calls a server; the
//     registry never reads storage, never parses a URL and never compares
//     machine ids. `src/lib/app/servers.ts` stays the one authority on which
//     saved server is which (phase ② binds `ServerEntry.id` as the key).
//   - pick a focus. There is no "current" entry here. `ws.ts` keeps its own
//     memory-only compatibility key, and that is a property of the facade,
//     not of this map.
//
// Two `ensure` calls with the same key return the SAME object, so a caller
// cannot accidentally mint a second client for one server.
