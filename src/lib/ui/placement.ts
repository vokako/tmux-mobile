 * viewport on both axes so it is never partly off screen. A zero height means
 * "not measured yet", and then the flip is skipped rather than guessed — the
 * caller keeps the menu invisible for that one frame.
 *
 * `align: 'left'` is the dropdown reading (board #32): the menu's LEFT edge
 * sits on the anchor's left edge — a menu that expands a NAME downward starts
 * where the name starts. Same flip, same clamp; only the wanted x differs, so
 * the two alignments cannot drift apart.
 *
 * `side: 'right'` is BESIDE the anchor instead of under it (board #326, owner
 * 2026-10-09: "弹出的那个小窗口应该再往右一点 偏移开左边的侧边栏 现在经常点击
 * 按钮之后 小窗口就把上面的区域覆盖住了"). The desktop rail's bell and server
 * switcher sit at the bottom-left corner, so a menu placed under them flipped
 * up and clamped to the 8px margin — i.e. ON TOP of the rail, over the very
 * buttons the reader wanted next. Beside it, `x` is the anchor's right edge
 * plus the gap and is NEVER clamped back: the horizontal room becomes `maxW`
 * instead. The caller passes the box to clear, which for a rail control is the
 * button's vertical span with the RAIL's right edge — the popover then clears
 * the whole rail, not just the icon. No flip: the side is explicit, and `y`
 * aligns with the anchor's top, clamped into the viewport (so a tall popover
 * beside a bottom-corner control ends up resting on the bottom margin).
 *
 * Everything is in CSS pixels of the fixed layer's coordinate space; a caller
 * under CSS `zoom` must divide the trigger's client rect first (a client rect is
 * in visual pixels, a fixed child's `left` is in its own zoomed pixels).
