// Leave guards for a server switch (board 315).
//
// An in-place switch DESTROYS every server-bound component, so an unsaved
// editor or a dirty agent draft would be thrown away without a word. Each
// such component already owns its exit guard (Files' discard dialog, the
// Agents editor's leave confirmation); it registers it here, and the switch
// asks them all BEFORE anything changes. There is no second confirmation
// flow: the question is the component's own, in its own dialog.
//
// A guard on a page the user is not looking at is asked on THAT page: the
// switch reveals it first, so the dialog is seen next to what it would
// discard. Revealing must not destroy anything that has not answered yet
// (board 315 review P1): the host HOLDS every conditionally mounted page
// (Settings, which carries an Agents editor) for the whole walk, guards on
// the current page are asked before any navigation, and when the walk ends —
// either way — the user is put back on the page they started from. A cancel
// therefore loses nothing anywhere; a guard that disappears mid-walk did so
// on its own, never because the walk navigated it away.

// Framework-free and module-level: the instances live in different subtrees
// (the Files page, the Hub drawer's Files, the Agents page on the rail or
// inside Settings), and threading a callback through each host would be
// plumbing that a new host forgets.
