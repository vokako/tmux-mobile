// What the app points AT, once there can be more than one tmux server
// (board #335 ②). A name alone stopped being an address: two servers may both
// have a session called `work`, a room called `proj:work` and an issue `#3`,
// and a reference that carries only the name would silently resolve against
// whichever server happens to be current.
//
// A ref is an IDENTITY, never a payload. It carries the server plus the
// smallest thing tmux or the bus needs to resolve the object, and nothing
// else: a ProjectRef holds `projectId`, not the project's path, name or room,
// because then two modules would define what a project is and the copy in the
// ref would go stale on the first rename.
//
// HARD RULE — the serverId never reaches the wire. It names which CONNECTION
// carries a call; the call's own `session`, `target` and `room` arguments are
// exactly the strings a single-server build sends today. Nothing here builds a
// wire string, and this module imports no transport, so it cannot send one.
// `refKey` DOES mix the serverId into a string, and that string is a JSON
// tuple precisely so it can never be mistaken for a `session:window.pane`
// target if it leaks into the wrong argument — it would fail loudly.
