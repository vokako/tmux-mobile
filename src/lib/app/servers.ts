// Named server configurations — the multi-server registry (board #55).
//
// The client always had exactly ONE server in its keys (`tmux_address` /
// `tmux_token` / `tmux_socket`), with `tmux_address_history` as an unnamed
// recents list behind the Settings form. This module makes the servers a
// first-class REGISTRY (`tmux_servers`, named entries with stable ids) while
// deliberately keeping the old keys as the ACTIVE MIRROR: everything that
// already reads them — ws.ts, the reconnect machine, deep links, the Settings
// form, the boot auto-connect — keeps working unchanged, and a downgraded
// client sees exactly the single-server world it expects.
//
// Switching servers happens in place (board 315; it was a reload until then):
// App's switchTo owns the order, and this module owns its storage half —
// `parkFrom` files the leaving server's per-server keys (PARKED_KEYS) under
// its id, `pointTo` surfaces the target's, `activateSwitched` does it after
// auth. What you were looking at on server A is still there when you come
// back from server B (the "恢复目标不能串" half), and `tmux_machine_id` is
// parked the same way so A's failover set is never consulted while
// connected to B. The in-memory half (component trees, module caches) is
// App's resetServerMemory + the keyed content remount. `tmux_machines` itself stays GLOBAL — it is
// keyed by machineId, so entries cannot contaminate each other by design.
//
// Framework-free and storage-injected so migration, upsert and the switch
// plan are unit-testable without a browser.
