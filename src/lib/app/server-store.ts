// A server's own corner of storage (board #335 ②a-3).
//
// The per-server keys stop having two homes — a live unprefixed one for
// whichever server is current, and `<key>::<id>` where the switch files the
// one you left — and become resident at `<key>::<id>`. With two servers on
// screen there is no "the" live value, so a store that answers "which server
// are you asking about" is the whole mechanism.
//
// It is a `Storage` view and not a new accessor vocabulary on purpose. The
// per-project semantics — what a SeenMark is, that an empty draft removes its
// row, how `stepsRows` clamps — live in `hub-prefs.svelte.ts` and
// `notify-centre.svelte.ts` and must keep living there; a second copy here
// would be the "one mechanism per job" regression, and it would drift. ②b
// points those modules' storage at this view and leaves their logic untouched.
//
// Two rules decide what is scoped:
//
//   - a RESIDENT key is rewritten. `RESIDENT_KEYS` is `servers.ts`'s own
//     `PARKED_KEYS`: "parked per server" and "resident per server" are the
//     same set seen from two sides, so there is one list and a key cannot be
//     added to one and forgotten in the other.
//   - everything else PASSES THROUGH, unchanged. The user's preferences —
//     theme, fonts, zoom, language, shortcuts, notification switches, the feed
//     level, the sidebar collapse — are properties of the PERSON and the
//     WINDOW, not of a server, and scoping them would mean the same human gets
//     a different app depending on which machine they are looking at. The
//     registry's own keys (`tmux_servers`, CURRENT, `tmux_machines`) and the
//     active mirror (`tmux_address`, `tmux_token`, `tmux_socket`) pass through
//     too: their home is the `ServerEntry`, which already is per server.
//
// Not wired into production yet: ②a ships this and its tests; the ②b commit
// that switches every live read and write over is what adopts it.
