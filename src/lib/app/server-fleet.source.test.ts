// Maintenance pin for the runtime/fleet boundary (board #335 ②a-2). The
// behaviour proofs are server-fleet.test.ts; this file keeps the LAYERING
// honest, because each rule below is one line away from coming back and each
// would undo a different part of the design:
//
//   - the ws.ts facade inside a runtime → the runtime would reach the
//     compatibility slot's connection instead of its own, which is exactly the
//     "whichever server is current" bug phase ② exists to remove, and it would
//     be invisible as long as production holds one server.
//   - `localStorage` instead of the injected store → identity stops being
//     testable and a second runtime reads the first one's live keys.
//   - a write to CURRENT → recording a connection would move the focus, and a
//     background server could steal the screen (servers.ts: recording and
//     activating are different acts).
//   - an address used as a key → one machine would become two servers the
//     moment it answered on a second address (board #55).
