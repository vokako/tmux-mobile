// One server, as something the app can hold (board #335 ②).
//
// Phase ① made the transport an object; a connection still knows nothing about
// WHICH server it reaches — deliberately, because identity is storage's and
// `app/servers.ts` is its authority. A runtime is the join: a saved
// `ServerEntry` plus the connection and bound API that serve it, plus the
// capabilities that server answered for itself.
//
// Three identity rules, which are the reason this module exists rather than a
// field on Connection:
//
//   - `id` is `ServerEntry.id`, always, and it is IMMUTABLE for the object's
//     lifetime. Every view, store slot and persisted key in phase ② keys off
//     it, so a runtime whose id could change under its holders would quietly
//     re-point them at another machine.
//   - an address is a candidate ROUTE to a server, never a second identity
//     (board #55: one machine is one entry, however many addresses answer for
//     it). Nothing here keys anything by URL or host.
//   - the server that answers decides. If the machine that authenticates is not
//     this entry's machine, the dial does not become a connected runtime under
//     this id — it reports the canonical entry for the machine that DID answer
//     and closes the socket, because a live link routing another machine's
//     panes into this entry's views is the multi-server version of the bug
//     #335 ① fixed inside one connection.
//
// What a runtime deliberately does NOT own yet:
//
//   - RECONNECT. `app/reconnect.ts` reads `tmux_address`, `tmux_token`,
//     `tmux_machine_id` and `tmux_machines` off the live unprefixed keys, i.e.
//     off whichever server is current, so a second runtime would reconnect to
//     the wrong machine. It needs one scoped target reader, which is ②b's
//     commit; faking it here with a key-remapping storage proxy would be a
//     second mechanism to delete two commits later.
//   - FOCUS. There is no "current" here, exactly as in the connection
//     registry. Which runtime a page looks at is the context provider's (②a-3)
//     and App's (②b-1).
