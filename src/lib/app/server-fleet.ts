//
// Three layers, one job each, and the fleet is the wiring between them:
//
//   `core/connection-registry.ts`  object LIFETIME — one connection per key
//   `app/servers.ts`               IDENTITY — which saved entry is which
//   `app/server-fleet.ts`          the set of runtimes the app holds
//
// Like `registry.ensure`, `include` never dials: it hands back an idle runtime,
// because only the caller knows whether now is the moment to contact a server.
// And like the registry, it has no "current" — a fleet is a set, not a focus.
// Phase ②a's production fleet still holds exactly one member; the aggregate
// switch that fills it is ③.
//
// One machine, one runtime. `servers.ts` already guarantees one ENTRY per
// machine, so keying by `ServerEntry.id` is normally enough, but a caller
// holding a stale entry (a list read before a merge) must not be able to open
// a second client for a machine that already has one.
