// The server context with real components (board #335 ②a-3, decision D1).
//
// A source pin can say nobody reads the context after an await; only a mount
// can say that two subtrees bound to two servers each send to their own, that
// an action started before the user looked elsewhere still lands on the
// server it was started on, and that an owned subtree never so much as holds
// the compatibility slot's api (reviewer r1 §F).
//
// Nothing here is mocked: the real `ws.ts` is loaded, so the provider-less
// fallback is checked against the REAL facade — by object identity, and by the
// error a real unconnected transport gives. The harness turns every mocked
// export into a function, which cannot stand in for an api object anyway.
