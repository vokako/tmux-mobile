// Hub display preferences — the chat feed's detail level (owner ask:
// configurable in Settings, reachable from the Hub itself — the project
// title's menu carries the three levels; the old cycle control was dead code).
// Three levels, each a superset of the last:
//   chat   — messages only (what people SAID)
//   status — + status declarations and lifecycle notifications
//   tools  — + individual tool calls ("Edit src/lib.rs")
// Delivery receipts and undelivered-line reports are NOT levelled: they are
// about a message the user sent, so feedBlocks() surfaces them at every level.
// A FACTORY plus one default instance (board #335 ②a-4). Two kinds of state
// live here and they do NOT have the same owner:
//
//   per SERVER — the per-project maps (lead, read mark, draft, drawer, roster
//     disclosure) and which project was open. They are keyed by tmux session
//     NAME, and `app` on one server is not `app` on another; that is why a
//     switch parks them and `reloadServerState` re-reads them.
//   per PERSON and WINDOW — the feed level, the tool-row cap and the sidebar
//     collapse. Scoping those would give the same human a different app
//     depending on which machine they are looking at.
//
// So the factory takes its STORAGE, and ②b hands each runtime a store scoped
// to its server (`app/server-store.ts`), which rewrites exactly the resident
// keys and passes the person's preferences through. That is what makes the
// split above a property of the storage view rather than of a second code
// path here.
//
// NOT YET WIRED PER RUNTIME, which is not the same as uncalled: production
// reads `hubPrefs` below, built on `localStorage`, exactly as it read the
// module state before.
