// The notification centre (board #322, owner 2026-10-09: "我经常听到「嘟嘟」的
// 通知了，但是都不知道是哪个窗口的提示…在整个界面设置一个通知中心，让我能看到到底
// 提示了什么…方便我快速定位到回复我的那条具体消息").
//
// A BOUNDED INDEX of alerts, not a second chat history: the room is the one
// record of what was said, and each entry here only names a message in it
// (room + seq + id) with a one-line excerpt to recognise it by. So:
// - Clearing removes entries only; it says nothing about whether any room is
//   read (the room's read mark is hubPrefs.seen, moved only by reading).
// - Viewing one entry never moves a room's read mark.
// - An entry is viewed when its jump landed on the message, or when its room
//   was read past it (markRoomRead), so a read room never leaves unviewed
//   alerts behind; a message that arrived while the reader was at that
//   room's visible tail is recorded already viewed.
// - The 50-entry cap evicts the oldest ENTRIES; a room's unread state is
//   unaffected (that is hub_unread's job).
// - It knows only what this running client received: nothing arrives while
//   the app is closed (notifications.md, the running-client limit).
//
// Per server: the list lives in `tmux_hub_alerts`, one of servers.ts
// PARKED_KEYS, so a switch parks it with the rest of the server's Hub state
// and `reload()` reads the target's. Entries also carry the server id, and a
// jump request carries it too, so a late jump cannot act on another server.

// Two owners, because two kinds of state live here (board #335 ②a-4, the

//     existed only because a switch re-pointed the live key.
//   the SURFACE is per WINDOW. There is one bell, one popover and one jump
//     request in flight, however many servers are on screen — a second
//     anchor would mean two popovers fighting over the same corner, and a
//     per-server jump counter would let two requests both believe they are
//     current.
//
// The union — one bell counting both servers — is a projection over the logs,
// which is ②a-5's business, not a second list here.
//
// NOT YET WIRED PER RUNTIME, which is not the same as uncalled: production
// reads `centre` below, which is one log plus the one surface, exactly as it
// read the module state before.
