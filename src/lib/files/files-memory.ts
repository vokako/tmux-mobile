// What the Files pages remember about ONE server (board #335 ②a-4).
//
// Both Files instances — the page and the Hub's drawer — share this and
// outlive any one of them, which is why it was a `<script module>` block in
// Files.svelte. It is a record per SERVER, not per app:
//
//   - browse positions are keyed by session NAME, and `app` on one server is
//     not `app` on another (that is what `resetFilesMemory` existed for).
//   - a part id, a running attempt and its abort handle all belong to a
//     transfer from one machine. A switch stops them and KEEPS the part,
//     because the bytes are the leaving server's file.
//
// Extracted into a factory so ②b can hold two of them. NOT YET WIRED PER
// RUNTIME, which is not the same as uncalled: Files.svelte keeps ONE instance
// and production goes through it today, every rule below is the one it had,
// and `suspendDownloads`/`resetFilesMemory` still exist for App's switch.
//
// Two things ②b owes this record (reviewer, 2026-10-09):
//
//   - DROPPING AN INSTANCE IS NOT STOPPING A DOWNLOAD. A runtime must hold
//     this record together with that server's download rows, shared by the
//     page and the drawer, and removing the runtime has to forbid new
//     attempts, then `suspend` and AWAIT, then release. `suspend` snapshots
//     the attempts tracked WHEN IT IS CALLED; it does not seal off a later
//     `track`, and it is deliberately not given an auto-dispose of its own —
//     that belongs to the lifecycle wiring, in one place.
//   - A WEB ROW ID IS UNIQUE ONLY IN ONE RECORD. `web-1` of two servers is
//     two different rows, so a union list or a cancel dispatched across
//     servers must carry the owner; bare row ids from two records must never
//     meet in one map. A native `partId` already has a machine dimension in
//     it — the two kinds of id are not the same guarantee.
