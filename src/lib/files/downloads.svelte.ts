// The ONE record of ONE server's downloads (board #308). Every attempt
// registers a row here and its progress updates it; the Files feedback slot
// and the Downloads view both READ it, so the toast and the list can never
// tell two stories. In memory: the disk keeps what must outlive the app
// (finished files, resumable parts), and the view reads that from the shell.
//
// A FACTORY plus one default instance (board #335 ②a-4). The rows name paths
// on one server, so two servers need two records: a row's `path` means nothing
// without the machine it is on, and `forgetAll` exists precisely because a
// switch invalidates the whole list. `createDownloads()` is that record as an
// object; the exports below are ONE instance of it, shared by both Files
// instances (the page and the Hub drawer) and every attempt, exactly as the
// module-level store was.
//
// NOT YET WIRED PER RUNTIME — which is not the same as uncalled. Production
// runs through `downloadStore` today, exactly as it ran through the module
// state before: the conversion changed where the rows live, not who reads
// them. ②b gives each runtime its own instance and retires the module-level
// one, at which point "reset the store on a switch" becomes "drop the
// server's instance" and `forgetAll` loses its reason to exist.
//
// ②b's contract, because dropping an instance is NOT stopping a download
// (reviewer, 2026-10-09): a runtime's rows and its FilesMemory must be held
// together by that runtime, shared by the page and the drawer, and removing
// it has to forbid new attempts, then suspend and AWAIT the running ones,
// then release — never just drop the reference.
