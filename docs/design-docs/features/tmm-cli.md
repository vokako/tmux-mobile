# tmm CLI — the agent's hands

## What this is

`tmm` (binary at `src-tauri/src/bin/tmm.rs`) is the CLI front for the project
hub: one chat room per project and hook-derived agent states. It is the
**only active interface an agent has** to the rest of the
system — the CLI-only substrate decision from
`docs/exec-plans/agents-v2.md` §4.1: what an agent *says* goes through `tmm`,
what we *observe* arrives through hooks into `projects::telemetry`, and the
two channels are joined at read time.

There is deliberately no MCP tool surface for this. MCP requires per-backend
config materialization and three different schema dialects; `tmm` requires
one line in a system prompt. (The agora MCP daemon that once backed the Team
feature was deleted with it, board #100.)

Two subtrees break the client-of-the-hub shape on purpose: `tmm task` and
`tmm mcp` are purely local and never open a socket — see their sections below.

Every command answers tenet 6's question — "what can an agent not do without
it": send/log are the room, board is the shared task state, spawn/registry/
teams are delegation, project is workspace lifecycle, prompt/skills/mcp are
the identity assets, task is background work, agent is teammate control. A
command that no agent needs is not added; `--help` is the complete list and
this reference stays one screen.

## Commands

```
# the room (context from $TMM_PROJECT / $TMM_AGENT, exported by the launcher)
tmm send "@name <text>"              send to one or more recipients (@all, @human)
tmm send "@name /command [args]"     typed VERBATIM into its CLI, like the composer (#274);
                                     @name must be a managed agent (else exit 4, nothing
                                     recorded); "@human /x" is a chat message to the person
tmm send "@name <text>" --in 10m | --at 14:30   a WAKE: delivered then as "[wake] <text>"
                                     (yourself included); prints the time and wake id (#275)
tmm wake list [--all] · tmm wake cancel <id>   pending wakes; the setter or the human cancels
tmm task start <name> --wake [@who] -- <cmd>   wake @who (default: you) when it ends by itself
tmm send "<text>" --status           ambient progress; room-only, interrupts nobody
tmm scratch [--kill]                 the desktop's scratch terminal session (#324): ensure it
                                     (in $HOME, no project) and print its pane target, or kill it
                                     — only ever OUR session; a name held by anything else refuses
tmm gateway                          ensure this machine's gateway service is installed and running
tmm gateway start                    the gateway in the foreground (what the service and `server` run)

Global flags: `--project <session>`, `--agent <name>`, `--server <ws://…>`,
`--output json` (every read). Token from `config.toml`, overridable with
`$TMM_TOKEN`; server from `$TMM_SERVER`, default `ws://127.0.0.1:<port>`.

Central assets (skills, MCP defs, registry agents, teams) are the app's own
store; how they materialize into agents — built-in skills, one-url import,
isolated homes — is [agents-overview.md](agents-overview.md).

## Self-management: the app operates itself through its own CLI

Everything the UI can do to projects and the registry, `tmm` can do — and the
spawn prompt tells agents so. A lead can set up a whole project
(`tmm project create` → `up`), define a NEW kind of agent
(`tmm registry save`) and then spawn it: definition → instantiation →
delegation, all inside one conversation. This adds no authority: an agent
already holds a shell (it can run tmux or edit files directly), so first-class
commands only replace ad-hoc power with a documented, observable interface.
The former `can_hire` spawn gate followed that logic out on 2026-09-26 (owner:
"本身就是 agent 自己能够通过命令行获得的能力，不应该加到里边"): every agent may
spawn; the per-project cap alone bounds fan-out. `project up/down/archive` accept the SESSION NAME (resolved to the
project id via project_list), because the session is what agents and humans
actually see.

Verified with a real agent: a spawned lead briefed to "create a project at
/tmp/evolve" ran `tmm project create /tmp/evolve --session evolve`, verified
with `tmm project list`, and reported done — 21s end to end.

## The two hard rules

**Fail soft, never block.** The server is optional (agents-v2 principle 4):
an agent is a plain CLI process in a tmux window and must keep working when
the server is down. `tmm` enforces this with a 2s connect timeout, a 10s RPC
timeout, no retries: a dead server is one stderr line and exit 2, measured at
~20ms for connection-refused. Anything that calls `tmm` from a hook or a
prompt can treat it as fire-and-forget.

**Tiered exit codes** (multica's convention, adopted after reading its CLI
docs): `0` ok · `1` local/tmux failure (`tmm task` only) · `2` server
unreachable · `3` auth rejected · `4` not found (method missing on this
server — mobile or old build; or no such task) · `5` usage/params.
Agents and scripts branch on the class without parsing error prose.
`tmm task *` opens no socket, so it can never return 2 — see below.

## Background tasks (`tmm task`) — local tmux, no server

Retention is bounded since board #206 (30 min past death, every verb reaps;
`stop` closes; see "Retention is bounded" below).

The rest of `tmm` is a thin WS client: the hub subcommands go through
`rpc()` and `state.db` is owned by the server process. `tmm task` is the one
subtree that is purely local (`src-tauri/src/tasks.rs`, over `tmux.rs`), and it
has to be: **what an agent most often wants to run in the background is the
server itself.** A task manager that needed the hub to be up could not start
the hub. So `task` is dispatched in `main()` before `Config::load()` — which is
not just a read, it seeds a token and a machine id into `config.toml`, and a
command that only talks to tmux has no business doing that.

### `tmm mcp` — the CLI door that became a skill

The history matters because it explains the shape: for a few hours on
2026-08-28 this subtree REPLACED native MCP entirely ("可以不用各种 agent 内部
的 mcp 工具调用了，可以用 MCP Inspector CLI 来统一来做"), and the same day the
owner reversed the call ("mcp 工具还是用原生的方式调用吧，给 kiro 的 mcp 工具
开启 toolsearch。我们这个 cli 方式调用 mcp，只作为另一个 skill 就好"). The
final shape:

- **Native MCP is the invocation path**: registry defs materialize into each
  backend's own config at spawn (kiro `mcpServers`, claude `mcp.json` +
  `--strict-mcp-config`, codex `-c mcp_servers.*`, grok `[mcp_servers.*]`
  toml), exactly as before the detour.
- **kiro gets toolSearch**: managed kiro homes carry `toolSearch.enabled=true`
  with `minPct=0`/`minTokens=0` (`kiro_cli_settings` — written at spawn,
  backfilled by `refresh_hooks`), so MCP schemas are always DEFERRED into a
  compact list and loaded on demand through kiro's built-in `tool_search`.
  That is the progressive-loading behavior, natively.
- **`tmm mcp` survives as a SKILL** (`assets/skills/mcp-cli/SKILL.md`,
  imported into the store as `mcp-cli`): the system prompt does NOT teach it
  (a spawn.rs test pins that); an agent gets it only by listing the skill.
  Its niche is what native cannot do: per-call config reads, so `tmm mcp add`
  makes a server callable on the NEXT command with no restart, uniformly on
  every backend.

The subtree itself is the second purely-local one (like `task`, dispatched
before `Config::load()`):

- The verbs shell out to the **MCP Inspector CLI** (`$TMM_MCP_CLI`, default
  `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli`), which connects, invokes one
  method, prints, and exits — its exit codes are a stable contract (4
  unreachable, 5 tool error) and pass straight through.
- Discovery is **progressive, like skills** (owner, 2026-08-28: "渐进式加载…
  避免一次性加载太多上下文，有点像 toolsearch"): each tier loads only what the
  previous one made you want. `servers` prints names; `tools <server>` prints
  ONE LINE per tool (name — first line of the description; the reshaping is
  `mcp_cli::compact_tools` over the inspector's `--format json` output, so a
  50-tool server costs 50 lines, not pages of schema); `schema <server> <tool>`
  prints ONE tool's full record, read just before calling; `call` invokes it.
  The SKILL tells its reader to walk the ladder and never dump every schema up
  front (the system prompt deliberately says nothing about any of this).
- **Dynamic**: `tmm mcp add <name> --def '{"command":…}'` merges one server
  into the config NOW (creating `.tmm/mcp.json` in a fresh workspace), and
  because the inspector reads the file per call, the next call has it. Editing
  the file directly is equally valid — `add` is sugar.
- The config is a STANDARD `{"mcpServers": …}` file at
  `<workspace>/.tmm/mcp.json` — **the agent's file**: `spawn` seeds missing
  entries from the registry defs (`seed_mcp_config`) but an existing entry
  always wins and unknown entries are kept, so an agent can edit its own tool
  set and the NEXT call reads it — no restart, which the native path could
  never offer. `$TMM_MCP_CONFIG` (set at spawn) names it from any cwd; without
  the env var the CLI walks up from cwd like git does.
- `tmm mcp list|save|delete` (the central registry defs) stay RPC — they are
  the catalog; `servers|tools|schema|call|add` is the runtime.

### Why this belongs to an agent at all

An agent's constraints differ from a human's. Every tool call is a fresh,
TTY-less, one-shot shell; the only state shared between calls is the
filesystem and the process table; and the agent's own context gets compacted.
So:

- **The handle must be discoverable, not remembered.** A PID noted in the
  conversation is exactly the thing that rots. `tmm task list` is one
  `tmux list-windows -a` call that enumerates every task in every session, so
  an agent that lost its context can rediscover what it left running.
- **Output must be bounded.** Context is the scarce resource; `cat`-ing a
  500 MB log destroys the caller. `logs` scans the whole scrollback but returns
  a bounded tail (50 lines by default).
- **A real TTY matters more than it looks.** Two reasons. When stdout is a pipe
  or file, libc switches from line to block buffering, so a Python/Node task
  can write nothing to its log for minutes — an agent polling it concludes the
  task hung and kills a healthy process. And a TTY is what makes `C-c` reach
  the whole foreground process group, so `stop` collapses the process tree
  instead of orphaning its children (a `nohup`-ed `npm → tauri → vite + server`
  chain cannot be given that signal; `scripts/preflight.mjs` exists because
  those orphans really happened). The TERM/KILL escalation follows the same
  rule (2026-09-03 review): it goes to the pane's process GROUP (`killpg`),
  not to `#{pane_pid}` — that pid is the `sh -c` wrapper, and a TERM to it
  alone let `npm run dev` or a pipeline run on headless while the pane went
  dead and the task said `killed:term`. tmux starts every pane as a session
  leader, so the wrapper's pgid is its own pid and the group is exactly the
  tree the task started; `stop_ends_the_whole_process_group_not_just_the_wrapper`
  pins it with a wrapper that ignores INT and a `nohup`-ed child — the kernel's
  SIGHUP to the foreground group when the wrapper dies is exactly what such a
  child shrugs off, which is why the pid-only version looked fine in casual use.

`pm2` was rejected, not just as an extra dependency: **auto-restart lies to an
agent.** From a log tail you cannot tell "running fine" from "crashed five
times and retrying", and for a build task the restart loop is pure harm. A
standalone shell wrapper was rejected because `tmux.rs` already solves socket
discovery (`-S`), tmux binary location, and `capture-pane -J` wrap
normalization — bash would duplicate all three, badly.

### The three tmux facts it rests on (verified, tmux 3.7b)

1. **`remain-on-exit on` is what makes a finished task observable.** The pane
   goes `#{pane_dead}=1` with the code in `#{pane_dead_status}`, and the
   scrollback stays readable. Status *and* log retention from one native
   mechanism — no pidfiles, no sentinel files, no log files. A task that
   auto-vanished would be evidence destroyed: the agent could never find out
   why it failed.
2. **It must be set with `-w`.** Session scope would turn it on for every
   window the user has open, so their shells would stop closing on exit. Not
   ours to change. Verified: with a task running in the current session, a
   sibling window still auto-closes and global `remain-on-exit` is still `off`.
3. **The registry is a window option, not a file.** `@tmm_task` marks the
   window; `@tmm_cmd` and `@tmm_started` ride along so `list` needs no second
   lookup. The options are set *before* `respawn-window -k` runs the command,
   otherwise a command that exits in milliseconds takes its window down first.

Task names are globally unique — the name is the handle — so lookups scan all
sessions, and `start` refuses a name a live task holds (`--replace` to take it
over). Refusing rather than clobbering matches preflight's philosophy and keeps
parallel subagents from silently stealing each other's tasks.

### Retention is bounded (board #206, 2026-09-20)

Owner: "当 agent 每轮都用新名称执行 tmm task start，它默认开启 remain-on-exit，任务结束后窗口
仍保留；停止任务也不等于删除窗口，这样就导致大量冗余窗口堆积…只有特别长时的任务 异步任务 后台
运行的任务采用 tmm task 执行". Measured on the live tmux 3.6a: 40 task windows, 39
dead, aged 21h–7d, every name used once, never `rm`'d. Two layers were wrong:
retention was unbounded and manual (`remain-on-exit` kept every finished window
until someone ran `rm`; `stop` kept the window on purpose), and the skill
prompt read as "run any command as a task".

- **A finished task's window lives `TTL` past its death**, 30 minutes by
  default (`tasks::DEFAULT_TTL_SECS`; `TMM_TASK_TTL_SECS` overrides, 0 for
  tests). The clock is tmux's own `#{pane_dead_time}` — the epoch second of
  the LATEST death; verified on 3.6a: set when the pane dies, EMPTY while it
  is alive again after `respawn-window`, set anew on the next death — so a
  reused name is never judged by an old death.
- **Every `tmm task` verb reaps at its door**, ONE mechanism, local, no
  daemon/timer/file, working with the server down: `tasks::reap_expired`
  closes windows that carry `@tmm_task`, are `pane_dead`, and died more than
  the TTL ago — never a running task, never a window without `@tmm_task`
  (a plain dead window is not ours). A verb reaps AFTER its own work and
  shields its own target, so `logs`/`status`/`rm` on an expired task still
  answer; `list` reaps first so what it prints is what exists. Reaped names go
  to stderr (`--json` stdout stays clean).
- **`stop` finishes**: C-c → TERM → KILL as before, then it prints the last
  20 lines (`STOP_TAIL_LINES`) and CLOSES the window; `--keep` leaves it (and
  `logs` still reads it). Stopping an already finished task closes it too.
  `rm` is unchanged: close now.
- **The prompt reverses its default**: `assets/skills/tmm-cli/SKILL.md`
  (embedded as a built-in skill by `projects/skills.rs`, materialised to
  `<state dir>/skills/tmm-cli/SKILL.md` by `seed_builtin_skills()` at server
  start, which is where agents load it — so a changed asset lands at the next
  server start, not at merge) says the foreground is the default and `tmm
  task` is for long-running / asynchronous / must-outlive-the-turn work only,
  finished with `stop`/`rm` or reaped by the TTL.

Tests (`tasks::tests`, real tmux on a PRIVATE socket — a TTL-0 sweep on the
shared server would close the developer's own finished windows, which is the
production effect and not a test's): the expired task is reaped, the verb's
target is shielded, a running task and a dead non-task window are untouched,
a fresh death is not expired at the default TTL; `stop` closes with its tail,
`--keep` keeps, and `stop` on a finished task closes.

### A task runs as whoever started it (board #291, 2026-09-30)

Owner (14:55, LingTing): a line `@architect [queue-watch from data] …` showed
as the HUMAN's outgoing bubble, though the human never sent it. `data` had
started the watcher with `tmm task start lingting-queue-watch -- …`. A tmux
window starts with the tmux SERVER's environment, not the caller's, so the
task had no `TMM_AGENT` (its script exported `TMM_PROJECT` by hand) and every
`tmm send` inside fell back to `human`. Meanwhile the `--wake` hook of the same
task did carry the starter. One mechanism had two answers.

Now `tasks::starter_env` is the ONE definition of the starter, and both
consumers take it: the task command gets it as `respawn-window -e KEY=VAL`
(tmux's own door, set on every start, so a reused window gets it too), and
`wake_shell` prefixes the wake with it. It holds `TMM_PROJECT` (`--project`,
else `$TMM_PROJECT`) and `TMM_AGENT` (`--agent`, else `$TMM_AGENT`). Both are
always set, and empty when the starter has none, because tmm reads empty as
unset: a stale identity in the server's environment cannot leak in, and a task
the human starts speaks as the human. `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `TMM_SERVER`
travel only when the starter has them, because an empty `TMM_SERVER` would be
read as an address. A task pane is not its starter's turn (board #285), so a
task's `@<starter>` send reaches the starter too. A task no longer has to
export `TMM_PROJECT`/`TMM_AGENT` itself. Rows already recorded as `human`
(state.db seq 10820, 10962, 11123) are not rewritten. Pinned by
`a_task_runs_with_its_starters_identity` (`tasks.rs`, real tmux: a stale
server env, a fresh window as an agent, a reused window as the human).
Negative control: dropping the `-e` fails it with `agent=[stale]
project=[stale]`, which is the bug.

### Two things that read as bugs and are not

**`logs` filters tmux's own `Pane is dead (…)` line.** tmux writes it into the
pane, on the bottom row, padding the gap above with blank rows. Left in, a
bounded `--limit 5` returned five blank lines and the real output fell out of
view. So `logs` returns task output only (and only strips the marker for dead
tasks), while `status` stays the single place that reports how it ended.

**A signal death is not an exit code.** `State::Killed(String)` is fed from
`#{pane_dead_signal}` (tmux names it: `kill`, `int`, `term`). The first cut
reported a SIGKILL as `exited:-1`, which is a lie an agent would then act on;
JSON now carries `exit_code` and `signal` as separate fields, one of which is
always null. `Exited(-1)` survives only as the "dead and tmux told us nothing"
fallback.

### Naming

`task`, not `bg`: the existing management surface is `<noun> <verb>`
(`project up`, `registry save`), a noun is what `list` can enumerate, and
shell `bg` actually means "resume a *stopped* job", which is the wrong
semantics. `spawn` was unavailable — it already spawns agents. `start`, not
`run`, because `run` implies it blocks and returns output, and an agent holding
that mental model waits forever. No aliases: they double the surface an agent
can get wrong to save three characters.

### Known limits

- Output lives in the tmux scrollback, so anything past `history-limit` is
  gone. Deliberate: writing a log file would bring back the CR/ANSI sludge
  that makes `capture-pane` output nice to read in the first place.
- Tasks are tmux windows, so `tmux kill-server` takes them with it.
- The `tmm-tasks` fallback session keeps one idle shell window (the one tmux
  creates with the session). Harmless, and it keeps the session alive between
  tasks.

## Waking an agent later (`--in` / `--at`, board #275)

Owner, 2026-09-29 08:04: agents running very long jobs sat in `sleep`, which blocks the turn and burns context. `tmm send "@name text" --in 10m` (or `--at 14:30`) lets the agent end its turn instead. The server types the line later, through the same path as a line sent now. No CLI has a native way to do this (measured: kiro-cli 2.22.1 and codex-cli 0.154.0 have nothing; Claude Code 2.1.284's background sessions cannot type into another pane), so one mechanism serves every backend.

- **A declaration.** Each wake is a row of `wakes` (state.db v29, `projects/store/wakes.rs`). It is not a `deliveries` row: a delivery is one line already typed for one window, waiting for its echo, and a wake's recipients are resolved only when it fires. One sleeper (`projects::wakes::run`) waits until the earliest due time; a schedule or cancel wakes it. There is no tick.
- **At most once, and from the row.** The sleeper holds only a wake's id and due time. `fire_wake(id)` claims the row (`fired_at`) and reads it back in the same store step, then fires with the row's CURRENT session, so a rename while the sleeper waited cannot send it to a dead room (validator 09:54). A second fire does nothing. A crash between the claim and the post loses that one wake rather than doubling it. At server start every past-due row fires once, in due order, and says `(late: was due …)`; there is no drop window, because the 7-day limit already caps the delay (orchestrator 08:20 B).
- **One fire path, one record.** The fire posts `[wake] <text>` as the SCHEDULER, in the `[reply]` marker shape, and delivers it with `deliver_mentions`. So busy/queue/steer holding and team context apply exactly as for a line sent now, and when A wakes B, B's reply returns to A. The room records it once, when it fires; nothing is posted at scheduling.
- **Self-wake: two rules.** (1) `deliver_mentions` never types a line back into its sender, except a fired wake or a post detached from the sender's turn (both `to_sender`; the second is board #285, below), so an agent's `tmm send "@$TMM_AGENT …" --in 10m` reaches its own pane. There is no `@me` alias: a second self-name would be a second rule (orchestrator 10:21). (2) An agent is never its own reply target (`take_reply_targets`): replying to its own wake would type the answer back into the same pane, a loop. Rule 2 holds for every prompt, not only wakes.
- **The CLI says so (board #283).** Because of rule 1, an unscheduled `tmm send` whose only recipient is the sending agent reaches nobody. It is refused with exit 5 (usage) and names the two doors: `--in 10s` or `tmm task start <name> --wake -- <cmd>`. When other names ride along, the CLI checks them against the live roster with the same `hub_agents` read a `/command` target uses (#274; orchestrator 14:28: say only what is true). `@human` is a real recipient; `@all` is one only when another managed agent exists; any other name must be a managed agent. If none is real (an unknown name, `@all` in a room where the sender is the only agent) the send is refused like a self-only one, naming the unknown tokens; otherwise it is sent and stderr says the sender's own copy is not typed, naming any unknown token. A roster read that fails fails the send as any RPC does. `--status`, a wake and the `human` identity (`--agent human`, `TMM_AGENT=human`, or none; it has no pane) are unaffected; the server skip does not change. Incident: LingTing watcher scripts run with `nohup` inherited `TMM_AGENT` and posted `@<self> [watcher] …`; `✓ sent` hid five lost notices on 2026-09-29, one a training failure found 68 minutes late. Pinned by `a_send_to_yourself_is_refused_unless_someone_real_else_gets_it` (`bin/tmm.rs`). The refusal and the note apply only to a call made by the agent's own turn (next rule).
- **A script the agent left behind is not its turn (board #285).** The skip exists so a turn cannot type into itself. A watcher started with `nohup … &` inherits `TMM_AGENT` and even `TMUX_PANE` from the agent's pane, then outlives the turn under init, and its `@<self>` copy is exactly what the agent needs (owner, 2026-09-30: four LingTing job notices lost in two days, even after #283). So `tmm send` asks the process table, not the environment: the call is the agent's turn only when `$TMUX_PANE` is the agent's own window AND this `tmm` descends from that pane's `#{pane_pid}` (`from_own_pane`, `descends_from`: `/proc/<pid>/stat`, else `ps -o ppid=`). Otherwise (reparented because its parent shell exited, as with `nohup … &` or `setsid`; no `TMUX_PANE` as under cron or a k8s hook; a pane that is gone; a `tmm task` pane) the post carries `detached: true` and `hub_post` types the sender's copy too: the plain `[tmm chat …] <agent>: …` line everyone else gets, not a `[wake]`, because it is the same message. `@all` then includes the sender. A turn's own call keeps the skip and the refusal above. So does a process started by the CLI's OWN background run (kiro `run_in_background`, Claude Code's background Bash): it stays under `node ← bun ← kiro-cli-chat` inside the pane, a descendant of `pane_pid`, so its `@<self>` is skipped (validator 06:06, measured). The skill says so and points at `tmm task start --wake`, which reaches the agent from a task pane. `detached` is a courtesy flag like `--agent`. Measured on this host 2026-09-30: an in-turn call's chain is `zsh ← node ← bun ← kiro-cli-chat ← kiro-cli ← <pane zsh = pane_pid>`; the LingTing watcher's parent was `systemd --user`. Live scratch check (one kiro, v3 engine): a nohup'd script with the kiro pane's `TMUX_PANE` and `TMM_AGENT=kiro` sent `@kiro [watcher] …`; kiro received it and answered; kiro running `tmm send "@kiro …"` in its own turn got exit 5. Pinned by `a_call_is_the_agents_turn_only_when_it_descends_from_the_pane` (`bin/tmm.rs`, pure chain plus the real process table) and the detached post in `a_fired_wake_reaches_its_own_sender_once` (real tmux). Negative controls: a server that ignores `detached`, or a walk that always answers "descends", fails them.
- **Limits.** `--in` is at least 10 s, with units s/m/h/d that can be summed (`1h30m`). `--at HH:MM` is its next occurrence: today, or tomorrow when already past (orchestrator 08:20 C). `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` is taken as written. The CLI always prints the resolved local time and the wake id. A wake is at most 7 days ahead, at most 50 are pending per project, and it needs an addressee. A `/command` cannot be scheduled yet (orchestrator 08:20).
- **See and cancel.** `tmm wake list [--all]` and `tmm wake cancel <id>`. Only the scheduler or the human may cancel, so a teammate cannot drop your reminder by mistake (orchestrator 08:20 A). This is a courtesy rule against mistakes, not a security boundary (orchestrator 09:33): tmm has no per-agent authentication, and every verb (send, board, agent stop/remove, wake cancel) trusts the declared `--agent` / `TMM_AGENT`; the token authenticates the client, not the agent. The UI shows the next wake as one hover row on the addressee's card, `wake 14:30 · builder +2` (`hub_agents.wake`, `wakeLine`). There is no badge and no UI cancel (tenet 11).
- **When a task ends: `tmm task start <name> --wake [@who] -- <cmd>`.** Most sleeps wait for an end, not a time. The task's pane gets a tmux `pane-died` hook that runs `tmm task wake <name>`. That verb schedules a wake due now, with the body `@who task <name> exited:<code> after <age>; last lines:` followed by the last 15 lines. Measured on tmux 3.6a: the hook fires once per death with `#{pane_dead_status}` or `#{pane_dead_signal}`, and not for a command that `respawn -k` replaces, so no wrapper is needed around the task's command (orchestrator's fallback). The hook's shell command lives in a pane option expanded with `E:`, so no task name or path goes through tmux's command parser; literals are `#`-escaped. The hook carries `TMM_PROJECT`, the starter as `TMM_AGENT`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, and the server the task was started against (`--server` or `TMM_SERVER`), but never the token: tmm reads it from config, as an agent's tmm does. An `@` in the output gets a zero-width space after it, so a log line never addresses anyone. `tmm task stop` clears the hook first, because the one who stopped it knows. Every start sets or clears the hook, so a reused window never keeps an old one. Fail-soft and visible (orchestrator 09:33): with the server down nothing is sent and nothing retries, and the reason is recorded ON the task (`@tmm_wake_err`). `tmm task status`, `list` and `logs` then print `wake not sent: @lead was not woken (…)`. It is not printed into the pane itself because a dead pane's tty is closed: measured on tmux 3.6a, neither a `run-shell` hook's output nor a write to `#{pane_tty}` appears on its screen. Every start of the task clears it, with or without `--wake` (`a_wake_failure_is_recorded_on_the_task_until_it_restarts`). Pinned by `a_wake_task_runs_its_command_once_at_its_own_end` (real tmux: one run for a self-ended task with its status, none for a stopped one, none after a restart without `--wake`) and `a_task_end_wake_says_how_it_ended_and_addresses_only_its_target`.
- **Renames.** Wakes are keyed by the project's session, like the board, and follow a rename in the SAME `set_session` transaction (validator 09:31). That is less surface than keying them by the project id, which would need an id lookup on every wake call. Pinned by `a_wake_follows_two_renames_and_fires_once_into_the_real_pane` (after A → B the list, hover and cancel see it; after A → B → C, firing the id the sleeper held from BEFORE the renames posts once into C's real pane and room). Negative controls: without the move, B lists nothing; firing the pre-rename snapshot fails the test.
- **Pinned by** `a_fired_wake_reaches_its_own_sender_once` (real tmux: an ordinary self-addressed post types nothing, the wake reaches its sender, a second fire types nothing more, one room record), `an_agent_is_never_its_own_reply_target`, `the_sleeper_fires_missed_wakes_once_then_new_ones_on_time`, the store claim/cancel test and the CLI parse tests. Negative controls: dropping the `to_sender` exception, the self-target filter or the claim each fails its test.

## The gateway (`tmm gateway`, board #323)

Owner, 2026-10-09: "通过输入 tmm gateway 就可以启动后台的 server…做成 Linux 或 macOS 下的一个后台进程任务". `gateway::start` (`src-tauri/src/gateway/`) is the ONE start path: `tmm gateway start` runs it in the foreground, the `server` binary is a thin alias of it (the dev watcher and existing units launch that name), and the installed service runs `tmm gateway start`.

- **Bare `tmm gateway` = ensure the service is installed and running**; `install` is the same verb with `--replace` available.
- **The service** is a launchd LaunchAgent `~/Library/LaunchAgents/cc.voka.tmux-mobile.plist` (the label clawdbjs already ran by hand since #313 — deliberately not the app bundle id `com.tmuxmobile.dev`) or a systemd user unit `~/.config/systemd/user/tmux-mobile-gateway.service` (`Restart=on-failure`, `WantedBy=default.target`). It runs `<absolute tmm> gateway start --service` directly — no shell — with `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (the config ROOT, the parent of the app's config dir), `HOME` and `PATH` in its environment; never the token. **`--service` loads config.toml ALONE** (`Config::load_service`): a user manager's environment cannot change the service's port, bind, token or TLS, so the service and `status` always read the same thing. The unit is rendered with systemd's quoting (`\`, `"`, `%` specifiers, `$` expansion in ExecStart; `$` stays literal in Environment=); the plist is SERIALISED by the `plist` crate. A newline or NUL in any value is refused. It lives in the user session (launchd `gui/<uid>`, systemd `--user`): on Linux a headless host needs `loginctl enable-linger <user>` for it to start at boot; it is never a root daemon.
- **Identity, structurally.** Every verb reads the installed file back. Ours = exactly our shape for this name: a plist parsed as a structure (XML or binary) whose `Label` is the file's name and whose `ProgramArguments` is exactly `[<this tmm>, gateway, start, --service]`, with `EnvironmentVariables.XDG_CONFIG_HOME` = this root; a unit with exactly one `ExecStart="<this tmm>" gateway start --service`, the last `Environment="XDG_CONFIG_HOME=…"` = this root (systemd's own last-wins), and no `ExecStartPre`/`EnvironmentFile`/`UnsetEnvironment`/`ExecStop` lines. Only a file that does NOT EXIST is absent; any other read or parse failure is "not ours". Not ours → refused with what it names, never adopted, overwritten or removed (`uninstall`, `restart` and `logs` included). `TMM_GATEWAY_SERVICE` must be a bare file name (no separator, no `..`, no leading `.`/`-`, `.service` on Linux).
- **Native operations are checked** (`service::Sys`, injectable; the tests drive a fake init system). Before installing when ours is not running, the probe must say `None` — a held port, or this machine's gateway answering outside this service (a foreground `start`), refuses before anything is written, because a new instance could only fail and the other answer would mask it. A stop that fails aborts before the file changes, unless the service is confirmed not loaded. Install, a forced start and `restart` WAIT (10 s, bounded) until OUR instance runs (its pid stable) and the probe says Ours, and fail with the last reason otherwise; the CLI exits non-zero. Same identity and same bytes and running → nothing at all happens (the pid is kept); same identity, different bytes (a new PATH) → stop, rewrite, load, wait. `--replace` is the explicit migration: it copies the old file to a backup name no earlier backup has (`<file>.bak-<ts>-<n>`), stops it (a failed stop changes nothing), writes ours, loads, waits; on failure it stops ours, copies the old file back, loads it and checks it runs — and reports both errors, keeping the backup, when that restore fails too. `restart` is the only forced restart.
- **`status`** is read-only (`Config::peek_service`: nothing is created, so it never makes a machine look configured) and prints the service state (installed / running pid / not ours) and the local probe's verdict — `answering at <url> (this machine)`, `occupied — <why>`, or `not running` — then the listen address, the config dir and the connect hint; the token only with `--show-token`. Exit 0 only when our gateway answers.
- **The probe** (`gateway::probe`) logs in with the server's OWN challenge: it waits for the `server_nonce` greeting (anything else is not our gateway), answers with a fresh client nonce and the v2 HMAC proof, and accepts only a reply sealed under the s2c key — so the token never crosses the wire (an echo server receives a nonce and a proof; validator's fixture), and a plain "authenticated" answer is a forgery, not ours. `Ours` = a sealed answer with our machine id; `Occupied` = everything else that answers, with a CLASSIFIED reason (not a WebSocket, not the protocol, token refused, cannot seal, another machine, a TLS failure, no answer in 1.5 s) — no peer bytes are ever quoted; `None` = connection refused. The address follows the config (a wildcard bind is reached on the matching loopback, a specific address on itself; `wss` when TLS is configured). TLS is verified by rustls's `WebPkiServerVerifier` with the configured certificate as the only trust anchor (signature, validity period, subjectAltName against the dialled address) plus a pin on that leaf; a `CA:TRUE` certificate is reported as needing a leaf certificate. Only `None` means free. A second `gateway start` on a taken port fails and says who holds it.
- **Smoke** (`scripts/gateway-smoke.sh <tmm> [port]`) on a real systemd user manager: preflight refuses when the test unit exists or the port is taken; every call is `env -i` with only HOME, PATH, the user bus, the scratch `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and the TEST name `tmux-mobile-gateway-test.service`; an EXIT trap stops and removes only the unit this run wrote (it must still carry the scratch root), keeps the journal and unit as evidence on failure, and exits non-zero; every check is an assertion. It proves `--service` ignores `PORT=1 HOST=9.9.9.9`, the unit carries the root and no token, the service listens on the scratch port, status sees it, a second install keeps the pid, restart changes it, a second foreground start names the holder, another executable's uninstall is refused and changes nothing, a path-escaping name is refused, uninstall removes it. A forced failure after install leaves no unit behind.

## Server side — where each verb's design lives

`hub_*` RPCs in `src-tauri/src/server/hub_rpc.rs`, dispatched by prefix in
`connection.rs`. The room is `proj:<session>` in state.db's `hub_msgs`
(`projects/rooms.rs`, board #107); a room is implicit — it exists exactly when
it has messages. Mobile has no projects store, so every `hub_*` method answers
method-not-found there (`tmm` maps it to exit 4).

The rules behind each surface live next to their design, not here:

| surface | design doc |
|---|---|
| chat store, feed, paging, drafts, images | [hub-feed.md](hub-feed.md) |
| delivery, receipts, status derivation, vitals, activity log | [agent-status.md](agent-status.md) |
| recipients, `/commands`, the palette, interrupt | [hub-composer.md](hub-composer.md) |
| the task board (`hub_board_*`, `tmm board`) | [board.md](board.md) |
| spawn, isolated homes, registry, per-backend knowledge, AGENTS.md | [agents-overview.md](agents-overview.md) |
| project lifecycle, restart/resume | [projects.md](projects.md) |

## CLI/UI parity

Every agent and project verb is reachable from both the chat UI and `tmm` —
the CLI is not a subset (owner: "所有的 Agent 也可以通过 TMM 命令直接交互所有
的操作"), because an agent that can only be managed by a human cannot manage
a teammate:

| | CLI | UI |
|---|---|---|
| Agent | `tmm agent interrupt\|stop\|restart\|remove <name>` | roster card/context menu: Watch / Interrupt / Restart / Stop / Remove |
| Input mode | `tmm agent mode <name> queue\|steer` | kiro card context menu: Switch to Steer / Switch to Queue (#271) |
| CLI command | `tmm send "@name /compact"` (`@all` = everyone else) | composer: `@name /compact` (#274, one rule: `address::slash_command` ⇄ `slashCommand`) |
| Project | `tmm project up\|down\|archive\|delete <session>` | header: Open / Close / Delete (archive is the list's own action) |

`remove` is the eject button next to stop's pause button: it kills the window,
DROPS THE SLOT (so `up` never recreates it) and deletes the isolated home (so
`is_managed_in` stops recognising it). `delete` is archive's irreversible
sibling: it closes the session, removes every `<path>/.tmm/agents/<name>/` the
app created, and forgets the row (slots cascade; the Board's issues go with a
permanent delete, board #41). Two things both verbs leave alone on purpose:
**your files** — we only ever delete inside `.tmm/agents/` — and **the chat
history**, because the room is the record. In the chat UI, delete is a recycle
bin, not destruction (hub-feed.md); the raw CLI keeps the sharper verbs as-is.

## Verified

Against the live server: `project list` (6 projects, ● markers), `send` →
`log` roundtrip (message in `proj:tmux` with ts cursor working), `--output
json` on all reads. Dead server → exit 2 in 21ms; wrong token → exit 3.
Unit tests: derivation table (9 cases), hub dispatch (4 cases), all in
`cargo test --lib`.

`tmm task`, end to end against the real binary: a task started in the current
session reports `running`, then `exited:7` with the code from
`pane_dead_status`; `logs --limit 3` and `logs --grep error` both return
bounded, already-rendered text; `stop` on a process trapping INT and TERM
escalates and reports `killed:kill` with `exit_code: null`; `rm` on a running
task exits 5, `start` on a taken name exits 5, `status` on an unknown task
prints `missing` and exits 4. Scope: global `remain-on-exit` still `off`,
session-level unset, a sibling window still auto-closes. `-- printf %s|%s|%s
--release --limit -f` reached the command verbatim, proving flags after `--`
never touch the parser. With `TMUX`/`TMUX_PANE` unset the task lands in
`tmm-tasks` and stays fully operable from outside tmux. 13 unit tests cover the
pure helpers (quoting, row parsing incl. signal vs status, bounded tail, grep,
dead-marker strip, name validation, ages).
