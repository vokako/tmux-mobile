# UI Unification — one sidebar, one vocabulary

## Current authority (2026-09-10, board #159 / #154)

[Design language](design-language.md) owns current tokens, controls, form
geometry and interaction states; [motion](motion.md) owns motion. This file
records how shared ownership was established. Its dated measurements and
implementation descriptions below are historical, not alternate token values.

Keep shared sidebar atoms and `SideHandle`, not private copies. Sidebar/page
identity headings use `--font-display`, not the old mono heading; rows use
`--ui-radius-row` (12px), feedback `--t-fast` (120ms), not 9px/160ms.
Configuration field labels are not identity headings. Exact configuration
canvases, headers and column budgets belong in [design-language.md](design-language.md)
with the #155/#156 implementation, not in this historical inventory.
Reuse means shared interaction, state and accessibility behavior, not forcing
every kind of content column to the same width.

## Context (the mess, inventoried 2026-08-01)

The desktop shell grew page by page and each page rolled its own left column:

| page | left column | width rule |
|---|---|---|
| Hub | projects list | `220px` fixed |
| Agents | definitions list | `minmax(280px, 0.9fr)` — proportional |
| Sessions | (the page IS a list) | full width |
| Files / Terminal | none | full bleed |

Two pages, two widths, two resize behaviors (none and none-but-different).
Switching rail tabs makes the left region *jump*. On top of that, visual
primitives are copy-pasted per component and have already drifted:
`.chip-btn`, `.ava`, `.side-h`, `.icon-btn` each exist twice (Hub,
AgentsPage) with subtle differences waiting to happen.

Owner direction: the rail's pages must share ONE sidebar region — same
geometry, manually adjustable — and the UI vocabulary must stop forking.

## Decisions

### 1. Sidebar geometry is owned by the shell, not the page

**Scope clarification, 2026-09-10:** this established a shared resizable
navigation region, not a universal content-column width. The approved
configuration direction uses column budgets and folds before editor actions
become unreachable; the implementation must verify that behavior.
The original inventory below predates Files' sidebar adoption later in this
record; it is not a current page inventory.

One CSS variable, set on `:root` by App and persisted:

```
--sidebar-w        default 240px, clamped 180–420px
localStorage key   tmux_sidebar_w
```

Every desktop page with a list + detail structure uses `var(--sidebar-w)`
for its left column: today that is **Hub** (projects) and **Agents**
(definitions). Pages that are genuinely full-bleed (Terminal, Sessions,
Files) do NOT get a fake sidebar — the rule is "wherever a sidebar exists,
it is THE sidebar", not "every page must have one".

Rationale for a var over a layout component: the pages keep their internal
grid (compact behavior, drawer columns, `:has(.editor)` collapse) and only
delegate the *width*. A shared layout component would have to absorb every
page's special cases; a var absorbs none and still guarantees the geometry
can never disagree.

### 2. One resize affordance

## One dialog shell (board #317, 2026-10-09)

`src/lib/ui/Dialog.svelte` is THE modal shell. The scrim, the card, the one
motion, `aria-modal` with the caller's role and label, Escape, the Tab trap
and the focus restore live there once; a caller passes its WORDS and its
actions as children and nothing else.

**What it replaced, and how it drifted.** `ConfirmDialog` owned the whole
contract. `AddServerDialog` (#315) re-typed it with a slightly different Tab
selector. `CreateProjectDialog` and the Hub's team picker had copied only the
PAINT — so by 2026-10 the app had three dialog shapes (`--bg2` vs `--bg`,
440 vs 420px, radius 18 vs `--control-dialog-radius`, z-index 30/31 vs 60/61,
one with no fade at all) and two of them had **no Escape, no Tab trap and no
focus restore at all**: a phone user could open the team picker and tab
straight out of it into the page behind the scrim. The #315 review (P2) asked
for the extraction and it was split out as #317 because moving
`ConfirmDialog`'s source contracts with it is more than a rename.

**One shape, so three readings had to converge** (2026-10-09): `--bg`,
420px, `--control-dialog-radius`, the fade on `--t-fast`, 12px content gap,
`max-height: calc(100vh / var(--ui-zoom, 1) - 48px)` and the sheet's
`padding-bottom: calc(16px + var(--sab))`. Every `vh/vw` stays divided by
`--ui-zoom` — the lesson of the unreachable DirPicker confirm button (owner,
2026-08-25: "创建project选择路径，没看到确认按钮").

**The content classes are global atoms in app.css**, not scoped CSS inside
the shell: children belong to the CALLER's component, so a rule scoped in
`Dialog.svelte` would never match them. Shared: `.dlg h2`, `.dlg-note`,
`.dlg-error`, `.dlg-actions`, and the sheet's 44px touch floor for inputs and
action buttons. A dialog's own fields stay with the component that owns them.

**There is no `class` prop** — that is the door the four copies drifted
through. The one species difference, the confirmation's circular corners
(#161), is keyed off `[role="alertdialog"]` in app.css, so the role that
already describes the dialog carries it.

**Back belongs to the HOST, not the shell.** The phone's Back is a layer
chain (App's `popstate` handler, Hub's `backLayers`); a shell that consumed
`popstate` itself would race that chain and peel two layers for one gesture.
So each host registers its dialog: App peels `addServer` as its FIRST layer
(a dialog is modal — peeling a page layer behind it would act on something
the reader cannot see), Hub registers `picker`/`create`/`action`/`trash`, and
Projects/Sessions/Files peel theirs in their own `goBack`. Review of #317
found the gap that rule creates if a host forgets: **Sessions** hosts
`CreateProjectDialog` and did not register it, so on a phone — where Sessions
IS the Terminal page's drawer — Back could not dismiss New Project at all. It
registers it now, and `Sessions.mount.test.ts` exercises the real chain.

**Escape is a CONSUMABLE dismissal (#317 review, 2026-10-09).** The shell owns
one window-level listener, so by default it answered for layers it knows
nothing about: cancelling a NAME in `DirPicker`'s new-folder field closed the
whole New Project form and took the draft with it. The shell now asks
`escapeGuard()` first and closes only when nothing consumed the key (it still
`preventDefault`s either way — the key was handled by someone). The order has
ONE definition, `CreateProjectDialog.goBack()`: the new-folder field, then the
picker, then the host closes the dialog — and that same function is what
Sessions and Hub call for Back, so the two dismissals cannot disagree about
what a draft is. The component that owns the state exposes the cancel
(`DirPicker.cancelLocal()`, the `ServerList.cancelRename` dialect); the shell
never reaches into a child. The scrim is deliberately NOT routed through the
guard: clicking outside the dialog is unambiguous.
`CreateProjectDialog.mount.test.ts` walks the three layers with a draft in the
form; negative controls: a shell that stops asking, and a `goBack` that skips
the field, each fail it.

`ui/dialog.source.test.ts` also pins that one peel order across the shell, the
dialog, DirPicker and both hosts. It fails the fifth copy: no component outside the
shell may declare a `.dlg`/`.dlg-backdrop`/`.dlg.sheet` rule or render a
`dlg-backdrop` element, all four dialogs must render `<Dialog>`, and the
shell must keep the modal contract (top-modal-only keys, IME-safe Escape,
busy-blocked cancel in one place, the focusable set, the focus restore, the
one motion, no class door, no `popstate`). `ui/Dialog.mount.test.ts` pins the
behaviour no single consumer exercised: focus in and back to the opener,
content that autofocuses keeping it, the Tab wrap over fields as well as
buttons, Escape ignored mid-composition, and a second modal owning the
keyboard. Negative controls: a re-grown `.dlg-backdrop` rule, the dialog
peeled after the page layers, and an Escape without `isComposing` each fail
exactly one test.

## One "New Project" surface

`CreateProjectDialog.svelte` (src/lib/projects/) is THE way a project is
born, wherever the button lives. The Chat sidebar and the Terminal sidebar
used to grow their own — the dialog vs an inline form with a SECOND directory
picker and raw kiro/claude/codex presets — which read as two different apps
(owner, 2026-08-19). The dialog survived because it carries the rules: the
required NAME that names project and session both, `DirPicker` over the same
`fs_list` the file browser uses, and registry agents (which seed real slots)
instead of bare backend names. It is self-contained — loads the registry,
runs create → up → spawn, and hands the created project back; the caller only
navigates (Chat selects the conversation, Terminal jumps into the first
pane). Sessions.svelte lost ~120 lines of duplicate form/picker with it.

`src/lib/files/DirPicker.svelte` is THE directory picker, for the same reason.
Team's "new team" workspace field had grown its own (`team/DirPicker.svelte`,
camelCase `onPick/onNavigate/onClose`, a breadcrumb path, no race guard, but a
new-folder affordance) beside the file browser's (`onpick/oncancel`, the
newest-tap-wins `seq` guard, list kept on screen while loading). Merged
2026-09-03 (review): one TypeScript component in `files/` with the guard AND
the new-folder input AND an `onnavigate` step callback, one lowercase prop
dialect; `CreateProjectDialog` and `Team` both use it.
`DirPicker.source.test.ts` pins that exactly one exists.

## Every sidebar speaks the same language

**Historical appearance:** the mono heading, tracking and 9px radius below
were the measured dialect at the time. They are retired token assertions;
current font/radius/feedback roles are linked above. Shared class ownership
and the reason scoped overrides drift remain applicable.

The Chat sidebar set the house style and the others follow it (owner,
2026-08-19: "所有的侧边栏风格尽量保持一致"): `--bg2` surface with a right
border, ONE uppercase mono section header per group (`.side-h`, `--fs-meta`,
`--text3`), borderless rows at 9px radius that only take a background when
they are active or hovered, and 8px gutters.

The outlier was the Terminal sidebar, because it renders `Sessions` →
`Projects`, which was designed as a PAGE of bordered cards. Those components
now take a mode flag instead of being duplicated: `Sessions chips={false}`
(also drops the MRU strip, see terminal.md) sets `.sidebar-mode`, which
tightens the content gutter and passes `dense` to `Projects`. In dense mode a
project card loses its border and surface, the group label becomes a plain
`.side-h`-style LABEL (no chevron: a sidebar section header is not a control,
and Chat's projects never collapsed), the row collapses to ONE line — dot,
name, age, with the path moved into the row's `title` — and its actions
(Close / archive) fade in on hover/focus-within. Windows stay under the row,
because picking one is why this sidebar exists, but as borderless text rather
than a tray of pills; that tray was the last thing still reading as a "card"
(owner had to point at it twice).

Measured after the change, Chat / Terminal / Agents sidebars all report the
same surface `rgb(238,238,240)` (light), 1px right border, 10.5px headers in
`--text3`, and 9px borderless rows.

`SideHandle.svelte` — a 6px grab strip on a panel's edge, and the ONE resize
affordance in the app:

- drag → live-updates a CSS variable on `:root`, persists on release
- double-click → reset to the default
- keyboard: arrow keys nudge ±16px when focused (a11y floor)
- hidden in compact/mobile layouts (they have no resizable columns)

It is PARAMETRIC, not sidebar-specific (2026-08-19): `varName`, `storeKey`,
`min`/`max`/`def`, `edge` (`right` default, `left` inverts the drag delta so a
panel grows when its left edge is dragged left) and `label`. Defaults describe
the shared sidebar (`--sidebar-w`, 180–420, 240), and the Hub's chat/terminal
divider passes `--hub-drawer-w`, 320–900, 520 — a second consumer instead of a
second implementation. The page that owns the variable restores it from
localStorage on mount; SideHandle is the only other writer.

`edge="top"` (board #324, the scratch terminal from the bottom) is the same
atom on the Y axis: dragging UP grows the panel, Up/Down nudge, the separator is
`aria-orientation="horizontal"`, the cursor `row-resize`. Every edge now clamps
to what the viewport can hold (zoom-corrected, 80px kept), so a size stored on a
larger window cannot overflow a smaller one. `always` keeps the handle on
narrow layouts for a panel that exists there; without it the ≤760px rule hides
it as before, so the left/right consumers are unchanged.

The handle is the only writer of `--sidebar-w` besides the App init read.

### 3. Shared primitives move to `app.css`

This is the original extraction table, not today's control/font specification.
The configuration command variants supersede its old button skin descriptions.

The copy-pasted classes become global utilities, deleted from components:

| class | role |
|---|---|
| `.chip-btn` (+ `.primary`, `.danger`) | small bordered action button |
| `.icon-btn` | square icon-only button |
| `.side-h` | sidebar/section heading (mono, uppercase, tracked) |
| `.ava` | agent monogram chip (color set inline per backend) |

Svelte scoped styles keep page-specific *layout* (grids, spacing); shared
*vocabulary* lives in one file. New pages must reach for these before
inventing buttons.

### 4. Rhythm rules (documentation, not framework)

**Retired values:** these original mono/160ms assertions do not apply to new
work. Use the current design-language roles and motion tokens, and its
configuration header contract as it lands rather than copying this historical recipe.

- Page headers: `padding: 10px 16px`, one `<h1>` at 15px mono for
  project-ish titles, borders with `var(--border)`.
- Section headings inside sidebars: `.side-h`.
- Interactive hover transitions: 160ms, color/border only.

These are conventions to follow when touching a page, not a retrofit pass —
retrofitting every page in one commit is churn without user value.

## Execution

1. `app.css`: add the utilities; App reads/persists `--sidebar-w`.
2. `SideHandle.svelte`; mount in Hub and Agents sidebars.
3. Hub `.cols` and Agents `.agents-root` use `var(--sidebar-w)`.
4. Components drop their local `.chip-btn`/`.icon-btn`/`.side-h`/`.ava`.
5. Verify: drag in Hub → switch to Agents → same width; reload → persists;
   compact/mobile unaffected.

## Hub Sidebar Ownership

Board #121, 2026-09-09: `hub/Sidebar.svelte` now renders the existing Hub
project sidebar. This is a component boundary, not another sidebar design:
the same aside and scrim remain direct siblings in Hub's grid, private
declarations move with the markup, and `app.css` still owns the shared
row/sheet/status atoms. `SideHandle` remains the one resize control.
The child requests selection, menus, restore and purge; Hub owns their
stateful consequences and Back. The unrelated private `.st`, `.note-dot`,
`.spacer` and `.empty` rules stay in Hub because this sidebar does not use them.

Verified with Chromium 152.0.7977.64 against the same fixed-data Hub fixture
before and after the move: 1440x900 and 390x844, light/dark, plus reduced-motion
spots. All 36 captured states had identical text, rectangles and computed
styles. Of 36 full-page PNGs, 23 were byte-identical; the others differed at
5-29 rounded-edge pixels (maximum channel delta 6, under 0.009% of a frame).
The eleven moved private CSS rules were byte-identical. Browser workflows
covered non-selected-row Close, restore and confirmed purge; the mounted
negative control routed Close to the selected row and failed on the wrong RPC
target. This verifies the component/layout move, not native Back gestures.

## Page skeleton (added 2026-08-02, owner: "reuse the project page's format")

**Historical rollout and measurements:** the mono headings, tracking, 9px
rows and 42px header below describe that rollout, not current configuration
requirements. The shared-class ownership lesson survives; the current
configuration work updates its contract with implementation (2026-09-10, #154).

Bar dialects found in the wild: Hub's header (`padding 10px 16px`, ~41px,
`border` color, mono h1) vs the compact `--ui-bar-*` dialect shared by the
Files toolbar and the Terminal win-bar (31px, `surface` bg, `border2`) vs
Agents (no header bar at all, 16px sans h1). Three dialects, one app.

**The Hub page is the reference format.** Two more shared classes:

| class | role |
|---|---|
| `.page-head` | THE page header bar: flex, `min-height 42px`, `padding 6px 16px`, `border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border)`, transparent bg; `h1` inside is mono 15px/600 |
| `.side-row` | sidebar list row (the Hub `.p-row` pattern): flex, `8px 10px`, radius 9px, hover `surface2`, `.open` = `accent-bg`, `.add` = dim |

Adoption:

- **Hub** — donates the pattern; its local `.mid-head`/`.p-row` become the
  shared classes.
- **Agents** — full adopt: left column becomes a real sidebar (bg2,
  `.side-h`, `.side-row` entries), the editor gets a `.page-head` (name +
  actions). Compact keeps list-or-editor.
- **Files toolbar / Terminal win-bar** — adopt `.page-head` geometry and
  border/background (their dense controls stay; only the bar itself is
  standardized). The 31px `--ui-bar-*` tokens remain for the Preferences
  modal tabs, which are a modal, not a page.
- **Files directory browser** (added same day) — the desktop left column IS
  the shared sidebar: `var(--sidebar-w)` + bg2 + `SideHandle`, replacing the
  page-private flex-fraction splitter (`tmux_files_frac` retired). Mobile
  single-pane chain unchanged.
- **Terminal** (2026-08-19, owner: "terminal 和 project 还是不统一") — the last
  holdout, and it differed in four measurable ways at once:
  - *No title.* The win-bar had copied the head's geometry but carried no
    `<h1>`, and worse, the bar only existed when the window switcher was
    EXPANDED — which is not the default (`tmux_winswitcher` unset), so a fresh
    desktop install showed a terminal with no header at all (measured: no
    `.win-bar` in the DOM, xterm at `top: 0`). Now the bar wears
    `class="win-bar page-head"` (geometry, border and the mono 15px h1 come
    from the shared class, not a copy), and collapsing hides the window CHIPS
    while the head stays — the current-window chip compresses to the bar's
    right end, which is what "collapsed" always claimed to mean. The identity
    slot is a three-way branch, because the bar plays three roles: a split
    CELL keeps its chip (it opens the cross-session pane picker), a PHONE keeps
    its chip (it opens the session sheet, that layout's sidebar), and the
    DESKTOP shows the title — there the sidebar is already on screen, so a chip
    would be the second door the owner cut. `flex-wrap: nowrap` is required:
    the phone `.page-head` rule wraps head actions, and this head is a scroll
    strip.
  - *A different New Project button.* A full-width bordered `.new-btn` in a
    bottom bar, next to Chat's and Agents' `.side-row.add` rows — the same
    dialog behind two unrelated-looking controls. The sidebar now renders the
    shared row (measured identical to Chat's: 223×35, 12.5px, radius 9, padding
    8px 10px, same ink) — since 2026-09-23 only while the list is empty; with a
    list, both sidebars put the command at the head as an `icon-btn` (owner:
    "每次还得滚动到最下边才能新建") — the bottom bar keeps only the two list utilities
    (search + refresh, right-aligned), and the `.new-btn` survives solely in
    the page dialect. The row sits in `Sessions`, not in `Projects`, because
    that section hides itself when there is nothing to list — an empty project
    list is exactly when the create row matters most.
  - *A different column width.* A hardcoded 280px with no resize handle. Now
    `var(--sidebar-w)` + `SideHandle`, so switching rail tabs no longer makes
    the left region jump. The 280px exception was justified by project CARDS
    with a wrapping tray of pane pills; dense mode retired both, so the
    exception expired with them.
  - *Two header dialects in ONE column.* The dense PROJECTS label imitated
    `.side-h` while TEAMS/SESSIONS stayed accent-bold — and the imitation had
    already drifted (1.05px tracking vs Chat's 1.4px). Both now WEAR the
    `.side-h` class; the page dialect is qualified (`.projects:not(.dense)`,
    `.sessions:not(.sidebar-mode)`) because a scoped `.group-label` rule
    outranks a shared class (0,2,0 vs 0,1,0) and silently overrode it. A flat
    session list also gained its own header, so no group of rows is unlabelled.

  Measured after the change, Chat / Terminal / Agents / Settings report the
  same head (`min-height 42px`, `padding 6px 16px`, one border colour), the
  same h1 (15px, `ui-monospace`, 600), the same sidebar surface
  (`rgb(238,238,240)`, 1px right border, 240px) and the same section headers
  (10.5px mono, uppercase, 1.4px tracking, `--text3`). Restating a shared
  property in a page's own stylesheet is how each of these drifted; wearing
  the class is the fix.

## Settings as a page (added 2026-08-02, owner: "not a floating window")

The category inventory below is historical — the live tree is
[requirements/pages/settings.md](../../requirements/pages/settings.md). The
tree was recut twice since: the one-row Terminal category folded into
Appearance (2026-09-24) and Chat split out of it (2026-09-25), and the
Connection debug toggle was retired (2026-09-26). The decision to use a page
rather than a floating modal remains; the exact Settings/editor form contract
belongs in `design-language.md` with implementation, not in this category
inventory.

The centered modal lasted one day: settings deserve the same skeleton as
every other page. `Preferences` becomes the `prefs` page — shared sidebar
with category rows, main column with a `.page-head` per category. The
categories are recut by SUBJECT instead of by history:

| category | contents |
|---|---|
| Appearance | theme, language, layout mode, UI zoom |
| Terminal | font family, font size, line spacing (previously mixed into Appearance) |
| Shortcuts | desktop-Tauri only (unchanged) |
| Connection | server info, addresses, hooks, share, disconnect, debug toggle |

The gear (rail bottom / mobile tab / disconnected top bar) navigates to the
page; no backdrop, no X. Compact drills category-list → detail like the
Agents page.

## Skills & MCP as first-class assets (same day)

The registry stored skills/MCP inline per agent — editing a shared MCP
server meant editing every agent. Now `reg_skills` (name → ref +
description) and `reg_mcp` (name → def) are central tables (state.db v6)
managed on the Agents page (sidebar sections AGENTS / SKILLS / MCP with the
same editors), exposed over `skills_*`/`mcp_*` RPCs and `tmm skills|mcp
list/save/delete` (self-management parity). Agent defs may reference both
by NAME: spawn resolves a skills entry matching a reg_skills name to its
ref, and an mcp array STRING entry to its reg_mcp def — inline objects keep
working, so nothing migrates.

## Out of scope (recorded, not forgotten)

Historical exclusions at the original rollout, not a restriction on #154:

- Sessions/Files as sidebar+detail pages (a deeper IA change; Sessions may
  eventually fold into the Hub sidebar entirely).
- A theme-token audit beyond the four utilities.
