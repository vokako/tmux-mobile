# WebSocket Client Robustness

## Context
Mobile connections are unreliable. WebSocket client must handle disconnects, reconnects, and edge cases gracefully.

## Decision
Custom WebSocket client (`ws.js`) with auto-reconnect, pending promise cleanup, and multi-address failover.

## How It Works
- `connect()` cleans up existing connection before creating new one
- `onclose` rejects all pending RPC promises (prevents caller hangs); each
  rejection carries a `reason` (e.g. `'connection lost'`,
  `'heartbeat: …'`, `'superseded by new connect'`) and an
  `err.code = 'DISCONNECTED'` so callers can distinguish cleanly.
- **Liveness is entirely at the WebSocket protocol layer now.** The server
  sends `Message::Ping` every 15 s; browsers auto-reply with `Message::Pong`
  at the WS layer without executing any application code. The server
  tracks `last_pong_at`; if it hasn't seen a pong in 45 s it tears down
  the connection. On the client that shows up as `ws.onclose` → reject
  pending RPCs → trigger reconnect UI. This removes all application-layer
  heartbeat logic from ws.js (previously ~40 lines of `lastRxAt`,
  `HEARTBEAT_QUIET_MS`, `pingInFlight`, etc. all gone). The key property
  it gets us: a 50 MB `fs_download` frame can be in flight for tens of
  seconds and the keepalive is completely unaffected — PING/PONG goes
  through the WS framing layer, not through our JSON-RPC mutex.
- RPC timeout is 6 s by default; long-running methods (`fs_download`,
  `fs_upload`) pass `60_000` at the call site.
- **3-consecutive-RPC-timeout disconnect is gated on `pending.size === 0`.**
  If a long RPC is still in flight, its single huge response frame is
  almost certainly what's delaying the short polling RPCs behind it on
  the shared WS send mutex — the link is alive, just monopolized. Let
  the pollers fail individually and keep the connection open. When the
  long RPC completes or times out, `pending.size` drops to 0 and the
  normal disconnect check re-arms.
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
- Multi-address failover: server `machine_id` tracks alternate addresses
- Optional E2E encryption layer
- `JSON.parse` wrapped in try-catch in `onmessage`
- Optional chaining on server push params (`data.params?.target`)

## Alternatives Considered
- **Socket.IO**: Rejected — adds dependency, WebSocket is sufficient for JSON-RPC
- **No auto-reconnect**: Rejected — mobile connections drop frequently
- **Application-layer ping (JSON-RPC `ping` method)**: used until the
  sent-by-server WS PING migration. Problem was that the ping *response*
  shared the send mutex with every other outbound frame, so a 50 MB
  fs_download could block the pong response behind tens of seconds of
  data even on a healthy link. We iterated twice on patches
  (`heavyRpcInFlight` counter, then `lastRxAt`) before realizing the
  real fix was to move liveness out of the application layer entirely.

## Trade-offs
- Custom reconnect logic to maintain
- Pending promise rejection can cause UI flicker if not handled in components
- Server-initiated keepalive means the server is slightly more complex;
  the ping_task must coexist with the send_task + receiver loop and
  share the same `out_tx` to avoid fighting for `ws_sender` (see
  `concurrent-ws-rpc.md` for the full task layout).

## Lessons Learned
- Always reject pending promises on disconnect — otherwise callers hang forever
- Manual disconnect MUST cancel reconnect timers — otherwise zombie reconnects fire
- Wrap `JSON.parse` in try-catch — malformed messages crash the handler
- Use optional chaining on server push params — malformed messages can have missing params
- Application-layer heartbeats look clean until they start fighting with
  real application traffic on a shared transport. The first iteration
  wrapped specific heavy RPCs; the second monitored last-received-at;
  both worked *most* of the time but both were working against the
  WS layer instead of with it. WS PING/PONG is the first-principles
  answer: it's exactly what the protocol designers gave us for this,
  and it runs at a layer that is unaffected by our JSON-RPC queueing.
- Client-side polling RPCs that Terminal fires in the background
  (`pane_command`, `list_panes`) are still plain `call()`s and can
  independently trigger the "3 consecutive timeouts" disconnect rule.
  On WAN a 50 MB download response monopolizes the send mutex long
  enough that 3 pollers time out before the download frame finishes —
  users saw the transfer abort "disconnected" halfway through. Fix:
  gate that disconnect on `pending.size === 0` so pollers failing
  behind a long RPC don't kill the connection. When nothing is pending
  and the link still silently fails, the disconnect still fires.
