# System Status (server vitals) — design

Board #56. The WHAT is in
[requirements](../../requirements/features/system-status.md); this is why the
pieces are shaped the way they are.

## The client's poll interval IS the CPU measurement window

CPU% is a delta (busy time / total time between two samples). The obvious
implementations both cost something the feature doesn't need: a background
sampler thread ticks forever for a corner nobody may be looking at, and a
sleep-inside-the-request (sample, wait 200ms, sample) stalls every poll.

Instead `system_status.rs` keeps ONE process-wide `sysinfo::System` behind a
`OnceLock<Mutex<…>>` and each RPC call reports usage **since the previous
call**. The client's low tempo (20s) becomes the measurement window — the
lazy path is also the honest one. Two consequences are deliberate:

- The **first** call of a server's life has no window and answers
  `cpu_pct: null`. The client drops that part for a tick rather than showing
  a made-up 0%.
- Two clients polling share the window (each sees usage since ANYONE last
  asked). For a glanceable number this is fine; it is the documented trade.

## Dependency: `sysinfo`, pinned exact, features cut down

`sysinfo = "=0.39.6"`, `default-features = false`, features `system` + `disk`
only (no process table, no network counters, no multithread refresh).

- **Why a crate at all**: the macOS half (host_statistics64 / sysctl FFI) is
  unsafe code this project cannot exercise in CI or on the Linux dev host;
  sysinfo's readers for both platforms are the ecosystem-standard ones. No
  shell-outs (`df`/`top` are slow and parsing them is a dialect per OS), so
  there is no injection surface and no subprocess cost.
- **Why exact-pinned**: the crate renamed its reading APIs across recent
  minors (0.30→0.31→0.33); a caret would let an unrelated `cargo update`
  break the build.
- **Why desktop-gated** (same `cfg` as `projects`/agora): a phone is a client
  of a desktop server and never answers `system_status`; the sampler would be
  dead weight in the mobile shell.

## Which disk is "the disk"

`pick_root_disk` (pure, tested): the exact `/` mount when present with a
non-zero total, else the largest mounted disk. macOS splits the APFS
container across a read-only `/` and a data volume; "largest total" is the
capacity a person means by 「disk容量」. An empty/unreadable disk list yields
0/0, which the client treats as "nothing to say".

## Client: transport injected, tempo floored, failure keeps the reading

`src/lib/system/` is self-contained: `system.ts` (wire type + pure
formatters) and `SystemStatus.svelte` (the corner). The component takes a
`load: () => Promise<SystemStatus | null>` **prop** — it never imports
`ws.ts`, so it tests with a stub and integrates into App with two lines
(mount + wire `load` to the RPC), keeping the App/ws territory free for
concurrent work.

- **Tempo**: `interval` prop defaults to `SYS_POLL_MS` (20s) and is clamped
  to `SYS_POLL_MIN_MS` (5s) — the server computes CPU% over this interval,
  so a hot loop would be cost AND noise. Hidden (`visible === false`) stops
  the timer entirely (the hidden-terminal lesson in miniature); re-show
  reads immediately.
- **Fail-soft**: only a truthy answer overwrites the reading ("I could not
  ask" is not "there is nothing" — the roster lesson), and nothing renders
  until the first success (the verdict rule).
- **Formatting**: `fmtPair` puts used/total in the TOTAL's unit so the pair
  reads as a fraction (`210/473G`), one decimal only under 10. Labels
  CPU/MEM/DISK are universal abbreviations — no i18n entries needed.

## Integration (App, board #56 final phase)

`ws.ts` exports the typed wrapper — `systemStatus(): Promise<SystemStatus |
null>` — whose `catch(() => null)` absorbs EVERY failure including an older
or mobile server's method-not-found: null is the reading the component
already treats as "keep what I have / say nothing", so no error can escape
into the page. App mounts the corner once, gated by ONE derived flag
(`sysMounted = connected && !layout.isTouchDevice` — a phone's server is
remote and its corners belong to the bottom bar), with `visible={connected}`
so a dropped connection stops the timer even before the unmount.

**The strip belongs to the primary sidebar, never the main column.** Board
#85 replaced the full-width flow footer after the owner reported that the
grey horizontal row still read as crossing the work area. App keeps ONE
polling instance in a shell-level `.sys-sidebar`: fixed at `left: 46px`
(after the icon rail), `width: var(--sidebar-w)`, with a single named 24px
height. The page keeps the full viewport height; no footer track, colour,
border, or empty reservation extends under the terminal/content column.

Fixed is safe here because space is reserved, not hand-waved: the three
shared primary-sidebar shells (`.sidebar`, `.term-side`, `.files-left`) get
bottom padding of that exact named height while the desktop rail layout is
active. Global `border-box` makes their content area end above the strip, so
their last row remains visible and scrollable. The strip is singleton rather
than copied into every page, preserving one poll timer and one CPU sampling
window. Its z-index sits below the icon rail and popovers.

Visual hierarchy is a quiet system-monitor readout, not three cards. The
shared sidebar background continues uninterrupted; each metric has no local
fill, border, radius, or padding. A restrained 4px accent/purple/green dot is
the only category colour, labels use `--text2`, and the actual readings use
full `--text` ink plus the mono data face. Both themes therefore stay legible
without making telemetry compete with the work.

## Tests

- Rust (`system_status.rs` module tests): first-call-null then bounded
  percent; `pick_root_disk` preference + fallbacks + degenerate cases; the
  serialized wire shape.
- `system.test.ts`: formatter behaviour incl. clamps and verdict-rule
  emptiness; the tempo constants.
- `system.source.test.ts` pins the contracts refactors would silently break:
  no ws/App/hub imports, the interval clamp, hidden-stops-timer, the
  failed-load-keeps-reading shape, tokens-only type.

## Rules and their reasons

Each entry is a decision with the reason it was made; treat them as normative. They lived in the root `CLAUDE.md` until 2026-09-02 (board #73), when that file became an index and the rules moved next to the design they belong to.

### Server vitals occupy reserved sidebar space; they never enter the main column

(board #56, refined by #85): desktop `system_status` samples CPU/MEM/root disk in-process through exact-pinned, desktop-gated `sysinfo`; the 20s client poll is the CPU delta window and first CPU is null. `SystemStatus` keeps the last good reading and stops hidden. App mounts one connected-desktop strip at the primary sidebar's exact x/width; `.sidebar`, `.term-side`, and `.files-left` reserve the same named height below their own content. The main page remains full-height and receives no footer row. A fixed strip without matching sidebar reservation, a full-width footer, pointer-through claims, and layer-only insets are all forbidden.
