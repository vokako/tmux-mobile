# Hub — the composer

Who a message goes to, the agent strip, `/commands`, readline editing and
per-agent interruption. The feed is `hub-feed.md`.

## Rules and their reasons

### Header path copy reports its actual result (#167 batch 2, 2026-09-12)

The desktop path stays selectable prose; double-click still copies its full,
untruncated value with the existing text-selection handling. Feedback follows the
clipboard result: only `copyText=true` shows Copied, through the shared
completion lifetime. A failed write now shows a retryable local error; previously
the result was ignored. A room/path/visibility change or unmount invalidates
the pending attempt, even when two rooms share the same path.
The same feedback presentation and placement action anchor to the path; this
adds no button to the header, notification transport or copy parser.

Each entry is a decision with the reason it was made; treat them as normative. They lived in the root `CLAUDE.md` until 2026-09-02 (board #73), when that file became an index and the rules moved next to the design they belong to.

### Confirmed actions retain their outcome (#167, 2026-09-12)

Response interruption remains immediate and amber. Process Stop/Close stays
behind the single danger confirmation, with an explicit stop glyph; removal,
archive-as-delete and purge use trash. The confirmation captures its project
ID, session and agent at request time. Pending Back is consumed by that
confirmation rather than falling through to the drawer/sidebar; this
deliberately replaces the old fallthrough assertion in `hub-back.test.ts`.

Failure stays in that dialog and retries the same intent. Project deletion
is still close then archive, not purge; a completed close is recorded on the
intent so an archive retry cannot close a newly resumed session again. A
failed step is named instead of swallowed. Purge keeps its own pending guard
and captured row. Success closes only its own confirmation, and room
generation checks prevent late success from navigating a newer view.

A successful mutation followed by a failed read is not a failed mutation.
The existing read functions can report an explicit action refresh failure
without changing silent background polling. That error uses the shared text
role and a read-only Refresh command in the chat pane, never another Delete
or Stop confirmation. A retry keeps that error and its disabled/pending
Refresh command visible until the read succeeds. There is no success toast,
timer or notification.
Real-Hub mounted regressions cover rejection/retry, duplicate activation,
pending Back, partial close/archive completion and refresh-only retry.
Review also caught a race exposed by separating mutation from refresh: a
second successful action could lose its refresh behind `actionRefreshing`,
then an older snapshot could restore obsolete cards. Each completed mutation
now starts its own read; project/roster snapshots and refresh feedback publish
only for their current request identity. A manual retry still cannot repeat
while pending. Ordered promises pin newer results arriving before older ones.
This adds no queue, timer or mutation replay.

### Controls are the paragraph's signature (#186, 2026-09-12)

Owner, 15:39, verbatim:
> 还是有一些问题，agent 卡片和展开按钮不在上下居中的线上。点击 everyone 图标，应该上方展示好像所有 agent 都被选中了一样。还有文字消息，应该能存在于按钮的上方，不是完全左右分列的，就应该像是发送这几个按钮是文字段落的最后一行的右对齐的落款一样。

The native textarea takes the full input width. All/Attach/Send remain the
same shared commands, positioned at its bottom-right. A real DOM measurement
mirror copies the textarea's computed font, spacing, wrapping and padding;
text is assigned as a text node, never HTML. Native Range line rectangles
are made local to that mirror with CSS zoom removed. This is text-layout
measurement, not viewport/popover positioning or character-count estimation.
The mirror is clipped to zero layout height, invisible, non-interactive and
ARIA-hidden; it cannot add scrollable space and is removed on unmount.

`signatureLayout` in hub-composer.ts owns the allocation decision from those
measured boxes and the actual command cluster dimensions. If the bottom-right
command rectangle is clear, it shares the last line. A real intersection
reserves one command-height band below the textarea. What collides is INK
with PAINT (board #203, owner 2026-09-17: "到了第二行 这 3 个按钮好像就被撑到下一行了
中间多出了空白的一行"): a line's rectangle carries its half-leading
(`inkInset` = (line-height − font-size) / 2) and a command's hit box extends
`--control-paint-inset` beyond what it paints. Measured at 1440: a 28px pointer
command beside 20.25px lines dipped 2px of hit box into the preceding line's
leading — nothing visible touched — and every two-line draft with a full
first line reserved a 28px band; now `reserved` is 0 there, still 28 when the
last line runs under the commands (right 1101 > 1068). A 44px touch command's
paint (inset 6) does reach the preceding line's ink, so the phone keeps its
band — the #186 rule that a tall touch target can hit a long preceding line
even when the last line is short still holds, measured against paint. **The
commands stand centred on the field's single-line height, not glued to its
bottom** (board #229, owner 2026-09-21: "消息发送按钮在详细框里行没有上下居中对齐"):
after #228 the phone's group is 32px inside a 44px line, and at `bottom: 0` it
sat 6px low. `.compose-line` captures `--composer-line-h: var(--control-height)`
before the dense group redefines the token, `.composer-actions` takes
`bottom: calc((line − control) / 2)` (6px on the phone, 0 on the desktop's
28-in-28), and `growComposer` reads that `bottom` back as `lift` so
`signatureLayout` moves the collision box AND the reserved band up by the same
amount (`reserved = controlsHeight + lift`, 38 on the phone). Measured at
390: controls 746–778 in a 740–784 field (centre delta 0); a short last line
shares the row; a last line under the commands reserves 38px. At the scroll ceiling the commands keep their own bottom band outside
the scrolling text; no typed line loses a permanent right column. Only an
empty placeholder gives width to the controls, and the empty field stays
one native control high.

The shell wears an input's radius (`--ui-radius-control`) and the row content
inset (`--menu-item-padding-x`) since #203: its 16px radius on a 32px desktop
shell was a full semicircle and the first glyph, 6px from the border, read as
squeezed into it (owner: "尤其是文字在靠近边缘的位置 感觉被挤到了半圆里面一样"); the
50px phone shell had read as a rounded rectangle all along. Since board #236
(round 3) the composer paints the BAND: a full-width fill under the tab strip,
the same fill the lit tab wears — the owner's Chrome screenshot: the active tab
and the toolbar are one colour, the omnibox its own field inside ("底下的框是一
个单独的一个输入框 但上面整体上你有这种tab 的这种样"). Round 5 made that fill the
agent bubble's (`--bubble-in`/`--bubble-line`); round 3's `--surface` is gone.
The shell itself stays a complete bordered field. `--composer-inset` is the
BAND's inline inset, which the strip consumes on its RIGHT only: since #237 the
strip has no leading inset beyond its 2px scrollport padding, so the first tab
starts at the column's edge the way a Chrome tab strip meets the window, while
the field keeps its inset — the lit tab's left edge no longer has to meet the
field's.

This explicitly reverses the #168/#180 no-mirror/side-column layout rule:
the mirror was unnecessary for a separate row, but is necessary for the
owner's signature layout. The old hardcoded SEND_ZONE, inline recipient
popup and send/interrupt arming are not restored. Existing width/height
observation (including changes to the command cluster alone), native input
events, font-preference changes, initial font readiness and subsequent
font-load completion all call the same growth owner. The font listener is
removed on unmount. Measurement retains #180's
synchronous row-height hold and notifies the parent only after the final
shell height changes. No value/caret rewriting, timer or layout animation
is added; draft, paste, IME, menu and transport owners are unchanged.

Verification: Chromium 152.0.7977.64 with the real Hub and isolated RPC
fixtures covers desktop, 390px coarse, 360px and wide-touch layouts, both
themes, reduced motion, long/short final lines, the preceding-line collision,
scroll ceilings, width/height changes and native CDP composition. The layout
matrix passes 810 checks, reduced motion 250, and deliberate missing-band/
wrong-font negative controls 41. A final source-hash-matched build passes
29 focused checks including command-only resize and font-completion wiring;
removing the font listener breaks parity, restoring it restores parity.
Unit vectors pin allocation; the real Hub mount pins late font events and
unmount cleanup. This is not an Android OS-IME acceptance pass.

The final global-font comparison also reproduced a pre-existing Feed issue,
recorded separately as #189: changing the UI font to DejaVu Sans Mono leaves
a 457px tail gap on the 390px fixture in both main `23e090fb` and #186,
while desktop remains at zero. It is not repaired by the composer change.

### One roster centre line (#186, 2026-09-12)

Owner, 15:39: "agent 卡片和展开按钮不在上下居中的线上。"
The disclosure wrapper now matches the card's painted height plus its
vertical inset and the scrollport's two 2px insets. Its native button is
centred inside that wrapper; the cards and Add align on their row centre.
There is no new size token or glyph offset. The wrapper remains bottom-aligned
when the list expands upward, keeping collapse at the same reachable position.
Chromium 152.0.7977.64 measured the old disclosure 3px below the card centre
on desktop and 1px below on 390px coarse input, in both themes. Both offsets
are now zero; restoring the old wrapper CSS reproduces the mismatch.

### The destination strip is a tab strip (board #236, 2026-09-22)

Owner: "Agent 卡片标题：能不能做成类似 Chrome tab 栏的样式？选中哪一个，哪一个
就是亮的，其他在旁边" — and on the pre-#236 look: "现在太多都是通过颜色块加选
择线框的形式了". The cards' wash + accent ring said "selected" with a colour
block and an outline; the tab says it with SHAPE and continuity: the lit
tab and the composer shell are one surface (the normative idiom lives in
design-language.md § paint species — rest bare, hover `--surface2`,
selected `--bubble-in` + `--border`, bottom open onto the shell in the
single-row strip; the wrapped expanded list keeps a closed rounded box,
a list is not a tab bar). The strip's bottom scrollport inset went to the
tab (it must reach the floor), so the disclosure wrapper height carries
`+ 2px`, not `+ 4px`. Status dots, context rings, unread marks, @ marks,
the dashed filter ring and the Stop-on-dot all survive unchanged — they
are function, not the retired chrome.

Three review rounds, same day (owner: "整体看起来比较生硬" → the Chrome
screenshot) and a fourth for contrast. Round 2 fixed the snap (the tab paint
transitions on `--t-move` ease — switching destination is the selection
MOVING, so it crossfades and reshapes; reduced-motion still disables it) and
patched the 1px seam with a z-index. Round 3 replaced the mechanism: the
outline + hairline model left
"一堆缺口" — a gap in the line under every lit tab, worst under All where
every tab is lit — because it said "attached" with LINES. The owner's
screenshot says Chrome does it with COLOUR: the lit tab and the composer
band share one fill, no borders, no hairline, and the input
stays its own complete field inside the band.

Round 4 gave that colour enough contrast to READ (owner: "选中和没有选中的
这些 agent card 的显示差异更明显一点…深色和浅色模式下都要考虑好"): a 3%
`--surface` wash on both the strip and the band left barely any step, so the
two fills became per-theme OPAQUE tokens in app.css. Opaque on purpose: the
lit tab and the band must be the SAME colour over different backdrops, which
a translucent wash cannot promise. The inactive tab's LABEL dims to
`--text2` as well — two signals for one state, as Chrome does — while avatar,
status dot and context ring keep their colours: those are live facts, not
chrome.

Round 5 put the step on the other side and joined the whole tray to the
conversation's own palette (owner, same evening): the lit tab and band wear
the AGENT BUBBLE's paint — `--bubble-in` fill, `--bubble-line` edge ("和
Agent 返回给我的消息框的亮度色彩差不多就可以…整体加一个稍微淡白色的边") — and
the contrast is the FRAME going darker beneath (`--hub-tab-frame`: dark
`#06060a`, light `#e2e2e8`), not a brighter tab ("会不会有点过亮了？…把其他
地方变得更暗的方式来解决呢"). `--hub-tab-band` is deleted: there is one
bubble paint, and a second token for the same colour would drift from it.
The enclosure closes without a seam because the lit tab's fill overlaps the
band's top edge by 1px — same colour, so the outline simply breaks where the
tab joins.

**Multi-select is ONE enclosure** ("如果是选择多个 Agent，就用一个大的包边。
注意 Agent 和 Agent 之间的卡片不要有很多线拐来拐去"): under All — and while
the All tab PREVIEWS it — `.tabs.all-lit` makes the DESTINATIONS GROUP the
lit tab (one fill, one edge, its join over the floor line) and
switches every card's own paint off. No border logic between siblings exists
to zigzag, and the per-card `preview` class is gone with it: hovering All
shows exactly the shape clicking produces.

Round 6 fixed what the first enclosure got wrong (owner, same evening). The
group is `.tabs` — the All tab plus the live agents — and it is sized to its
CONTENT, so the enclosure ends after the last agent instead of framing the
`+`, the stopped identities and the empty row behind them ("上面框的这个区域
有点过分大了…不要把加号后面的这些区域也都框出来"); naming that group is also
honest, since those siblings are not destinations. **`.tabs` carries
`flex: none` in the single-row strip**, and that is load-bearing: as a
shrinkable item of the scrolling `.cards` it absorbed every bit of negative
space once the tabs overflowed while its own `flex: none` cards did not, so
the cards spilled out of the group and the stopped cards and the `+` drew ON
TOP of them (review caught it before merge; Chromium at 300px with four 90px
tabs: group right 198 vs. last tab right 368, stopped card left 200). The
wrapped list is the opposite case and keeps `flex: 0 1 auto; min-width: 0`,
where the group shrinks to the container and wraps inside itself. Measured on
the phone at 390px with five destinations: group right 469 = last tab right
469, the `+` at 471, the strip scrolling as before.

**Superseded 2026-09-24 — the phone strip matches the desktop.** Measured on a
390px touch profile: row 44 → 36, All/+/disclosure 44×44 → 36×36, paint inset
6 → 2, the 32px paint unchanged; the compact `padding-block-start` shove on
the tab and All contents and the compact marker inset are deleted, since the
desktop inset needs neither. The owner's call ("手机对齐一下桌面…比桌面预留的还
要大…预留的都要宽") overrides the 44px floor here, as `.compact-tools` already
does for the dense tool groups; targets stay 36px on both axes.

**The phone card is at the touch floor; surplus row air can still shrink**
(owner, 2026-09-23: "tab 栏可以高度稍低一些…agent 卡片和下边的消息框之间间距小一
点"). On coarse the card's minimum comes from `.agent-select`'s 44px target,
not from its paint. The first round reduced card paint but left a disclosure
surplus in the row; that surplus was removed only in the later correction.
What did come out first: the coarse `--roster-paint-height` 34px → 32px (the card's
`min-height` was 46px, now 44px = the touch floor exactly), the band's top
padding 6px → 3px, and the scrollport's top inset 2px → 1px — six pixels of air
between the cards and the field, none of it target. And the band's `border-top`
is gone: a full-width top edge drew a horizontal rule between the strip and
the input area ("Agent card 和下面这个区域中间分隔的横线不要有"), while the lit
tab above already closes that side of the enclosure and beside it the frame
steps straight into the band's colour. Measured in both themes, desktop 1280
and phone 390: single selection and All. A further reduction of the band's
top padding from 3px to 1px missed the owner's intent. The 2026-09-23
correction restores that 3px and takes the space from INSIDE the tab row:
the now-unneeded 1px scrollport top inset and 2px disclosure surplus go
away together (the old upper team marker is gone). The 44px touch target
remains; compact tab content moves 2px toward its open bottom via
`--ui-gap` top padding within the same hit box, reducing the visible gap
below the name without severing the selected tab from the band. Chromium
152 desktop: row 36px -> 34px, name still 9px above/below, field top 6px;
at 390px with coarse CSS simulated: row 46px -> 44px, text gaps
14/14px -> 16/12px, field top 1px -> 3px. Real phone not measured.
The owner's 08:55 correction found the remaining root cause: the compact
button's shifted content put the avatar centre 2px BELOW its context ring,
which was independently positioned against the card. The ring now lives in
`.avatar-slot` beside the image, sharing its centre by construction. Ring
and avatar shrink from 26/20px to 24/18px; their 1px gap and 2px stroke
remain. Compact content padding uses two existing `--ui-gap`s, taking 2px
more from the text's bottom gap without shrinking the 44px native target.
The selected tab's paint top inset shrinks from coarse 6px to `--roster-gap`
(2px), while desktop stays at 2px; the strip itself still has zero top
padding. Top corners move from `--ui-radius-control` to `--ui-radius-panel`
(10px -> 14px; reversed to `--ui-radius-row` 12px on 2026-09-23 17:19 — "半圆
半径变大了…稍微小一点显得更加精致", and 12px is the context ring's own
curvature), the team pill to `--ui-radius-row` (12px); the bottom stays
open into the band. Chromium 152 before/after: desktop ring/face 26/20px ->
24/18px, their centre difference 0 -> 0, row 34px and text bottom 9px
unchanged; 390px with coarse CSS simulated: 26/20px -> 24/18px, centre
difference 2px -> 0, text bottom 12px -> 10px, selected paint top 6px ->
2px, row and hit box both 44px. The meter role and exact percentage remain
in accessibility output. Real Android WebView remains to be checked.

### All selects the addressed cards (#186, 2026-09-12)

Owner, 15:39: "点击 everyone 图标，应该上方展示好像所有 agent 都被选中了一样。"
The existing All command remains the single broadcast entry; it now also
selects every managed card's paint and `aria-pressed` through one `isAddressed`
predicate. Stopped slots remain unselected. A named card click still calls
the existing recipient setter, narrowing All to that agent; no membership
store or new destination is added. Hover wording names the aggregate
destination while All is selected. Body mention marks and reading filters
retain their separate meanings.
The real Hub mount test pins All -> every managed card -> one named card;
the single-name-only predicate fails as a negative control. Chromium
152.0.7977.64 verifies the same paint/ARIA states in both layouts and themes.

### One input row and one All command (#180, 2026-09-12)

Historical layout: #186 above supersedes the side-by-side row and no-mirror
rule. The All command, guarded live menu and measurement safety rules remain.

Owner, 14:22, verbatim (the subsequent 14:26 correction replaces only the
card's capacity encoding):
> A 背景填充的方案。everyone 的按钮应该是一个圆形的小按钮在 加号 左边 ，加号还是按照原来在发送键左边的方案，一起发发送的消息在同一行，就是不额外把消息框撑高一行，发送按钮在同一行就行，停止按钮可以是选中 everyone 后再次点击，才显示菜单栏选项 stop

Textarea and All/Attach/Send share one normal-flow flex row, in that order.
The textarea grows in the remaining width; commands align with its bottom,
not a separate footer. Attachments retain their own rows below it. Use the
existing natural-height measurement and CSS ceiling, not the retired mirror
or overlapping corner controls. Height notification measures the whole
shell, including attachments. Its local ResizeObserver watches the available
chat column and fixed command group, not the textarea it resizes, and reuses
the same calculation when text width or the CSS height ceiling changes.
Chromium 152 exposed both mistakes: observing the textarea produced resize-
loop warnings; a height-only viewport shrink left a 145px draft clipped to
90px with `overflow:hidden`. A shrink now enables scrolling, and growth
releases the old ceiling without waiting for another keystroke.
Natural-height measurement also holds the existing input row's minimum
height synchronously until the textarea's final height is set. Otherwise
`height:auto` briefly shrinks a four-line draft by 61px, expands the Feed
and clamps its scrollTop during a width resize; restoring the textarea
then leaves a 61px tail gap. The row hold is removed in `finally` before
the shell-height notification. It is not a mirror, timer or Feed correction.

All is the PINNED TAB at the strip's head (board #236, owner, 2026-09-22:
"不用隐藏，我不展开就看不到吧…都显示全了" — supersedes #204's expanded-only
gate, whose reason was the 2026-09-17 "藏到展开列表里"): Chrome pins a tab as
an icon-only tab at the far left, and this is that — always in view,
collapsed strip included, wearing `bots` — a small CROWD of the same bot mark
a single agent's glyph uses (owner, 2026-09-22: "不用画人，画成 Agent 类似的
Logo"; 2026-09-23: "可以多画几个机器人"; the group-of-people and `collab`'s
orbiting dots both failed the glance test). It used the avatars' size
(`--roster-avatar-size`, the token). The side-by-side heads each read at about
7px at the atom's 16px size
and looked muddled even at 20px (owner, 2026-09-23). Three heads now recede
behind a single readable foreground face; the rear contours end at the front
head rather than crossing its strokes. When the avatar shrank from 20px to
18px, rendering three heads at 18px became soft; the leading tab now has
its own `--roster-all-icon-size` at 20px, independent of the gap between
tabs. Its fine-pointer box stays 24px (`20px` icon plus `2px` per
side), and the strip has no extra leading inset beyond its 2px scrollport
padding. The field
keeps its normal inset; the tab's paint need not start at
the text field's left edge. On coarse the 44px square remains the touch
target even though that necessarily keeps some space around the icon.
Chromium 152 headless, isolated Roster/Composer preview: 24px fine-pointer
button; narrow viewport with the coarse CSS values applied: 44px All and
agent targets, 1px from the band top to its input field. The browser's device
emulation did not report a coarse pointer, so this is not a native phone
measurement. The tab retains `pressed`, `hasPopup` and `expanded` for the
All menu, wired into `Roster`
(`allMenuOpen`, `onall`). The span is `.acard` so selected All is a LIT TAB
like any card's; the CommandButton inside is `bare` and its `engaged` wash
is switched off locally — the tab is the paint, a wash inside it would be a
colour block again; the accent ink remains as the pressed signal. Hovering
or focusing the tab PREVIEWS the choice (owner: "鼠标悬停…看到的就是所有的
Agent 被选中或者激活"): `allPreview` lights every live, not-yet-addressed
card with exactly the selected tab paint (`.acard.preview` shares the
`.acard.sel` rule); touch never previews — a finger has no hover. #180's
"never a card" holds: no `data-agent="all"`, no Stop, no meter. Selected
All still opens the All menu on a second activation; Send is the only
solid CTA.
First activation selects `ALL_TARGET`; another activation opens the existing
Hub ContextMenu. Constructive Record only comes first and clears All
directly; the amber interrupt command appears only while members are busy,
disabled during an in-flight interrupt. A NAMED card follows the same shape
since #196 (owner, 2026-09-13: "agent选中卡片时，再次点击不是取消选中，而且展开选项卡"):
a click selects it; a second click on the card that IS the recipient opens the
Hub agent menu anchored to the card (left-aligned, card kept clear) with
Record only leading in place of "Talk to" — that is how a card is deselected
now; a click on any other card, or under All, moves the recipient. The click
toggle (`recipient === name ? '' : name`) is gone. A long-press opens the same
menu at the card too (`ui/longpress`, design-language.md § menus); a mouse
right-click keeps the pointer. `Hub.mount.test.ts` walks select → second click
→ Record only; Chromium 390: the menu's left edge = the card's (113), a hold at
finger x=77 on a card at 12 opens at 12.

The menu captures its opening room in the existing context-menu record and
closes if that room or destination changes. Its items follow current
busy/pending state while open, rather than freezing the opening snapshot.
Dispatch checks room, destination and this menu instance before revalidating
busy membership through the existing interrupt function. It
does not kill processes or change the recipient. No new listener, Back stack
or popup owner is added. Double Ctrl+C still mirrors the interrupt offered
for the selected named card or All menu; record-only is a no-op. The Send,
staging, draft, IME and command-palette gates remain in their original owners.
Chromium 152.0.7977.64 measures a 34px pointer / 50px coarse empty shell,
with native 28/44px controls on the same line. Seven desktop/390px light/dark,
reduced-motion and 360px variants cover multiline text, attachments, width
changes and menu actions; separate height-only shrink/grow and real Feed
scroll checks pass without ResizeObserver errors. Disabling only the
temporary row hold restores the 61px tail gap; removing that override
returns to zero. Browser coverage uses controlled RPC and synthetic IME;
native WebView/IME and owner-client acceptance remain separate.

### Comparable avatar meters and content-sized cards (#180, 2026-09-12)

Owner, 12:13, requested a narrower card and a meter integrated with it:
> Context window 百分比进度条：这个进度条现在看起来还是有点丑，感觉像在边缘框上多了一条线，这条线和原来的框没有任何关联。

After comparing card-ground fill and an avatar ring, the owner superseded
the temporary fill choice at 14:26:
> 背景色有一个不好的是有可能卡片宽度不一样，大家对进度感知不一样，要不用圆环的方案吧，注意头像一定用圆形，圆环刚好包括头像大一圈。然后 agent 卡片现在右边的空白太多了，就自适应卡片宽度，不要 撑开这么多。agent 卡片现在高度有点太低了，已经贴近头像边边了，可以稍微留一点边冗余，包括给进度圆环留冗余，还有颜色，就绿黄橙红，不要有中间插值不好看的过渡色，看着颜色怪怪的

The original 26px outer ring around a 20px avatar shrank to 24px around
18px after the owner requested a smaller, properly centred pair. Still, 1px
of ground separates the image from a 2px stroke. The card paints 30px high
for pointers and 34px for coarse input, leaving 3px/5px outside the ring. Its container
includes the existing paint inset; native commands remain 28/44px. Avatar
and ring stay round through the one app.css corner-policy owner.
The existing meter exposes its bounded value and exact reading through ARIA;
expanded cards also show the exact percentage. Unknown means no ring,
zero has an empty track, and over-capacity values fill one circle while
retaining their exact text.

`ctxColor` is the single capacity classifier: green below 50%, yellow at
50-69%, orange at 70-84%, red at 85% and above. These four existing status
tokens replace the interpolated CLI-statusline ramp. The 85% imminent-
compaction anchor remains; neither CSS nor JS interpolates between hues.
The ring has fixed geometry, independent of name/card width; the old edge
bar and the rejected ground-fill prototype are not production mechanisms.

The newer auto-fit request supersedes the 2026-09-11 08:41 hover-reveal
decision quoted under #173 below. Cards no longer reserve invisible Watch
or Stop slots. Busy cards carry their real Stop; idle cards carry no action.
Watch remains in the same right-click/long-press ContextMenu on both input
types. Hover never expands a card or covers its name with actions. The
expanded, height-bounded view wraps the same content-width keyed cards
instead of stretching them into fixed columns. Recency ordering, input-
held order, disclosure persistence, reading transaction and status dots
retain their existing owners.
During the existing pointer press lifecycle only, rendered Stop membership
is held so a turn ending cannot remove the pressed target or shift its
neighbors. Current busy membership still disables an ended Stop; release
on pointer-up/cancel adopts current layout, without a timer or another
classifier. Expanded percentage text reserves four monospace characters
(the wire value is u8), so changes from 0% to 100% do not move targets.
Chromium 152.0.7977.64 verifies 26/20px concentric geometry, circular
avatars, 30/34px paint, native target floors, content widths, hover stability,
menu Watch and the four colour boundaries across desktop/390px light/dark,
wide touch, reduced motion and 360px. A forced zero-fraction ring fails the
computed visual-fraction check and recovers after removing the override.
The mounted press regression proves slot retention with live disabling;
native-device gesture and owner-build acceptance remain separate gates.

### Compact card paint and secondary All (board #176, 2026-09-12)

Historical geometry: #180 above replaces the edge meter, reserved action
slots and 24/32px card paint, not the native scrolling/selection mechanisms.

Owner, 00:02 (repeating the 2026-09-11 screenshot report), verbatim:
> 这个card行太高了，看着太难看，你要做的精致一点，还有类似检查一下，很多卡片按钮什么的，不要这么傻大的，上下文的进度条稍微粗一点明显一些。还有这个展开箭头和卡片，中间直接硬截断了，不好看，要融合完整一些。
> 还有everyone按钮太大了，而且占据了主要位置，不好用

The strip had kept full-height card backgrounds after commands adopted inset
paint. Cards now use the same `--control-paint-inset`: 24px pointer / 32px
coarse paint inside unchanged 28/44px native targets. Remove the extra 4px
outer vertical padding; the ordinary strip becomes 32/48px, including its
2px scrollport padding. Skeletons use the same paint inset. Selection and
filter outlines follow the painted boundary rather than crossing the
20px avatar in the compact interior; focus and sibling Stop/Watch targets
remain separate. The existing `ctxColor` meter becomes 3px and straddles
the painted lower edge by 1px to clear the avatar, with rounded ends; percentage/ARIA and
missing-versus-zero semantics are unchanged.
Expanded names retain wrapping, with padding for the paint inset and meter.
This leaves ordinary single-line geometry unchanged while letting long names
grow their row instead of crossing the 3px meter.

All is secondary, after the named and stopped identities, before Add. It is
an icon-only choice in the collapsed strip, labelled in the expanded list
and always named in hover/ARIA and the selected-destination placeholder.
Its resting paint is neutral/unframed, not a permanently accented first
card; selected All retains the accent capsule. This deliberately supersedes
the first-position/broadcast-emphasis treatment from #168/#173, not their
selection or interruption contracts. The same busy-only All Stop remains,
including the double-Ctrl+C equivalence; no new destination sentinel.

The single native horizontal scroller meets the disclosure without an extra
gap. `ui/scroll-edges.ts` measures which physical ends still hide content;
the shared `.edge-fade` alpha mask softens only those ends. It is an overflow
cue, not an overlay covering actions or a substitute for fitting controls.
At an end, that end is fully visible; a fitting or expanded list has no
horizontal mask. Keyboard focus also suspends the mask: native Tab and
menu focus return otherwise leave an edge glyph/focus ring visibly faded.
One action observes scrollport/items and direct-child
changes, cleans up on unmount and adds no timer, custom scrolling or
selection listener. The same keyed list, recency hold, disclosure preference
and parent reading transaction remain authoritative.

### Card refinements (board #173, 2026-09-11)

Owner, 08:39: "卡片显示优化，context 长度比例还是直接帮我可视化出来，还有 everyon 可以换一个样式，不然我以为还是和 agent 会话一样。还有终止按钮，不要圆形的阴影了，还有这个黑方块看着不知道是停止的意思，是不是换个颜色？让我能更容易够理解这个按钮的含义。还有缺少了双击show 单独过滤某个 agent 消息的能力，是不是可以双击后，卡片样式给我一些改变。"

Originally 2px (strengthened by #176 above), `.ac-bar` restores context usage at the card's
bottom edge, in both strip and expanded views. It uses `ctxColor`, not a new
threshold or colour family; zero is a reading, missing data has no bar, and
over-capacity readings saturate the fill while hover/ARIA retain the exact
percentage. The track sits between the rounded corners, costs no layout
height and never intercepts clicks or clips the command focus ring.
Chromium 152 desktop/390px light/dark, collapsed/expanded comparisons keep
card and roster boxes identical across 16 captures; fill/track ratios match
the reported percentage. A zero-fill negative control breaks that ratio.

The everyone choice is a broadcast capsule: no avatar tile, a group glyph
and accent-ink label, with the same accent fill/border for selected state.
It is deliberately distinct from a named partner, not another agent. Its
round-corner exception stays in app.css, the existing corner-policy owner.

**Double-click focuses an agent** (lead clarification, 08:48). There is no
single-click delay or rollback: clicks act immediately, and a fine-pointer
double-click explicitly selects the live agent and toggles the existing feed
filter. The second click in that native sequence does not toggle selection
off. Another double-click clears the filter and leaves the agent selected.
Stopped slots only filter; their click menu opts into the shared
`menuHeightLimit` cap before `menuPlacement` measures/flips it. A viewport-only
clamp could cover the trigger when neither side fits the full menu; limiting
height to the larger side keeps the second click reachable and scrolls the
menu internally. Other menu callers retain their existing placement.
Coarse pointers and keyboard users retain the ContextMenu filter command,
which remains a reading-only choice. The strip IS the filter indicator
(owner, 2026-09-23: "不要在上面显示了，直接在我们的 Agent tab 栏做强化显示…
把当前的卡片直接亮起，其他全部变暗"): while a filter is on, `.cards.filtering`
dims every other card, the team labels and the All tab to
`--control-disabled-opacity` (an opacity crossfade on `--t-move`), and the
filtered card keeps full ink and an accessible label. The tab paint is
untouched, so dimming says "not in view" and the paint still says who you
are talking to. The feed's sticky banner with its ✕ and the dashed card
outline are deleted — one indicator, and the exit is where the entry was:
double-click again, the card menu's Show everything, or the back gesture.
A heavier avatar ring was the owner's other option; it was not taken
because that ring is the context meter. Dimming alone said that something
changed, not what (owner, 14:50: "只是颜色变暗了，没有任何提示…这个 Filter 和
正常状态的差异太小了"): the filtered card also carries the filter verb's own
`filter` funnel beside the marks column, in the marks' `--accent-ink`, and
its hover note names the mode and the way out (`hubFilterOnNote`).
Tests execute the complete click/click/dblclick sequence, not a lone
synthetic dblclick. Chromium also verifies repeat-to-clear, stopped-card
menu exclusion and the coarse-pointer long-press filter path.

Owner, 08:41: "还有我觉得交互可以优化，比如应该打断方块可以不一直显示，可以鼠标移到卡片上后，可以显示打断按钮，还有 show terminal 的快捷按钮也要显示"

**Stop stands on the dot, red, only while the pointer is on the card (board
#205, owner 2026-09-20: "终止按钮应该是红色的吧，更符合语义，而且默认不显示，只有鼠标移到上边，
把状态的小圆点变为终止按钮。手机端就不要了，节省空间，让用户用选项卡终止就好").** A busy
card at rest shows its state dot. Hovering or focusing it (fine pointers)
puts the `danger` icon command — the same shared `CommandButton`, 28px
`compact-tools` slot — exactly on the dot (`overDot` reads the dot's offsets
in the card's space; the dot hides underneath), so the card never changes
width and the row never shifts; a pending interrupt keeps its Stop so the
keyboard path has feedback (#173). Touch renders no Stop at all: the
long-press menu's Interrupt is the touch path. Measured at 1440: hover →
Stop centre (320, 841) = dot centre, card 71px wide before, during and after.
History: #173 revealed a resident amber Stop on hover; #180/#195 made it
resident while busy on both pointers, quiet `--text2` ink, with a press-hold
of the row's layout (`renderedStops`/`pressStops`) so the slot could not
shift under a finger — gone whole with the slot. Watch stays in the menu.

**The dot reserves the Stop's room, and the Stop wears no wash (board #211,
owner 2026-09-20: "agent 卡片状态小点右侧好像没有留边距，包括我鼠标悬浮的时候，停止按钮都超出
agent 卡片框了。而且停止按钮就不用加背景了，就红色方块我直接点就行").** Measured before:
the 28px slot centred on the dot reached 14px past the dot's centre while the
card had 3px (half dot) + 4px (`--roster-card-inset`) there — the hovered
Stop stood 7px outside the frame. Now a live card's `.agent-select` ends in
`--roster-dot-reserve: 12px` (= 28/2 − 6/2 + the 1px inset border): the slot,
which is also the focus ring's outer edge, ends at the border's inner edge.
The reserve is constant, not hover-only, so revealing the Stop still never
reflows the row; a stopped card has no dot and keeps its 4px. The Stop passes
`bare` to `CommandButton`: no rest, hover or press paint — the card under it
already carries the hover, and the red glyph is the whole control. Measured
at 1440 and 720 (compact), and in the expanded grid: card width identical
before/during/after hover (77.58px strip), slot right edge 379 vs card
right 379.58, paint right edge 3.6px inside the border, `::before`
background `rgba(0,0,0,0)` at rest and with the pointer on the button, ink
`--danger-ink`, Stop gone on pointer leave.

The state dot lives INSIDE the name's line with `vertical-align: middle` —
by definition the dot's midpoint on the baseline plus half the x-height, so it
is centred on the lowercase letters whatever the font's ascent/descent — 5px
after the last glyph. As a flex sibling it was centred on the LINE box (~1px
off, font-dependent) and 1–2px from the name (owner, same message: "状态小点稍微
有点挨得近了，而且上下不居中"; measured: dot centre 714 vs x-height centre 715,
gap 1.3–2px; after: 765.1 vs 765, gap 4.2–5px). Watch and the menu
share one parent adapter that selects the Terminal view before using the
existing pane resolver; a compact terminal
request uses the existing full-page Terminal callback. A missing requested
pane clears the stale terminal target rather than watching the previous agent.
Neither action changes the recipient. The Watch slot stays fixed; an idle
selection reclaims the
vacant Stop slot, keeping target regions separate. Chromium 152 verifies
18 desktop/390px, light/dark action states, stable reveal boxes, keyboard
reach/pending feedback and coarse fallback. Mounted tests exercise phone
and compact desktop routing including a vanished pane; the wide-browser
Files-to-Watch check stubs only the two renderer boundaries, proving routing
and identity rather than either renderer's internals.

### One roster above the input, one Stop operation (board #168, 2026-09-11)

Owner, 03:32: "我看到这个设计挺好看的，因为我们有多个 agent，可以在上边去展示哪些agent 在工作，并且我可以对某一个 agent 单独点停止。可以把原来我们的 agent 擦片就放到发送框上边的位置，然后我们消息输入框里，就不用 to 谁了"

The single `Roster` sits between Feed and Composer. Its native selection
button chooses `@name`; selecting it again chooses no implicit recipient.
An explicit everyone card chooses `@all`. The placeholder names that
destination, and the selected card's existing hover card explains delivery.
Body mentions still deliver through the existing parser; `chipExtras` uses
`mentionTokens` to mark reached cards with one `@` glyph, never a second
parser, dashed ring or selection change. The drawer's window selector has
a different purpose and stays. The owner-selected ordering and disclosure
below supersede the prototype's team-group adjacency.

**Final density and ordering, owner 07:09:** "用单行的形式吧，而且不要进行中这种文字描述了，最好有一个展开的小按钮，展开一个多行的 list ，但是限制高度，我可以一下子看到很多，而且 agent 卡片排序，一般最后活跃的放到最前边"

Cards have one line: avatar, name, the existing status dot, optional mention/
unread marks and a separate Stop. State words remain in hover/ARIA, not the
visible row. `sortAgentsForRoster` in `hub.ts` puts the existing busy membership
first, then sorts each busy/nonbusy partition by `since` descending and window
index ascending. For hooked agents this is turn-level recency: `since` is the
prompt start while running, ask time while waiting, and end time while
idle/failed, not the latest tool call. The server's existing no-hook fallback
is unchanged; the client adds no pane reading, clock, telemetry field or
history scan.
The 2026-09-11 global-order decision replaced the earlier team frame so every
agent could move independently. The owner clarified on 2026-09-23 that a
launched team should read as one Chrome tab group. `sortAgentsForRoster`
still owns the busy/recency rank; `rosterGroups` gathers members by root team
path after that sort, placing the whole group where its highest-ranked member
would have been and preserving the sorted order inside it. Solo agents stay
individual. Nested team paths (e.g. `dev/review`) share the `dev` group and
retain the full path in hover/ARIA; a second nested frame would fight the
small tab bar and the one-enclosure rule for All. A team with only one live
member has a stable team key but looks exactly like a solo tab. The group
adds no row height or status colour. The owner's Chrome tab-group
reference (2026-09-23, 558x88) supersedes the first 1px upper marker:
the team name is a native choice sized within the existing row — a
`--control-surface` pill until 2026-09-24, when the owner found the block
"有时候太大" and asked for the bare name: it now speaks through ink alone
(`--text2`, `--text` on hover and when the team is the recipient); a
`--text2` baseline sits in the group wrapper's
bottom pixel, behind the member cards. The selected member already has
`z-index: 1` and its bubble fill covers the floor-line pixel: it covers the
baseline beneath that tab. Its existing open-bottom outline takes `--text2`
only inside a group, rising from the group's baseline without sealing the
tab off from the composer. Solo tabs keep the normal faint bubble edge.
This is not a return to #236's deleted tray-wide rule: only the team itself
draws a baseline. The screenshot uses green; this implementation keeps a
neutral line because membership is not a status or selection colour.
The owner next asked for bottom LEFT and RIGHT rounding too (2026-09-23,
09:26). The first attempt rounded INWARD using `--ui-radius-row`; at
10:39 the owner corrected the direction to Chrome's small outward tangent.
The collapsed strip now widens ONLY its between-tab flex gaps from
`--roster-gap` (2px) to `--ui-gap` (4px). A selected named tab's two tangent
feet are 4px arcs confined to those real gaps, with the lower stroke of
the old vertical border removed only where the arc begins. The selected
team group has the same feet on its outer edges; All at the viewport's
left edge retains its original inner corners. The expanded list keeps
its old 2px gaps and no feet. The fill under each arc is the same
`--bubble-in` as the selected tab and composer, so `border-bottom: 0`
still joins the band. `--roster-gap` stays 2px: its eleven other readers,
including the group baseline and the instantly opaque join, must not
move with visual tab spacing. The All icon gets a named 20px roster metric
instead of avatar size plus gap. Chromium 152 at 390px with three team
members and two solos: the destinations width is 512.81px -> 524.81px
(+12px), scroll content 563px -> 575px, row and native targets stay
44px. Selected member's left/right feet ended exactly at the adjacent
pill/member hit-box edges with zero overlap. The owner's width tradeoff
is explicit: each of the six widened gaps costs 2px.
The owner's 14:29 review of that round found three faults, one root: each
lit enclosure (tab, team, All) drew its own silhouette. The 4px arc at a
1px stroke read as a staircase, and it sat in the gap one column OUTSIDE
the tab's side stroke, so the stroke went straight to the floor and the
arc started 1px beside it — on a team this read as "一个竖线和一个圆角";
All kept rounded lower corners ("成了一个圆角矩形"). Now ONE `.tab-foot`
pair serves all three: `--roster-foot-radius` (8px), its inner column ON
the side stroke's column (`calc(1px - radius)`), its fill covering the
stroke's stub below the arc, `z-index: 1` above a team enclosure's own
stroke. All's paint moved to `.tabs.all-lit::before` with the same open
bottom. The feet reach into the neighbour's empty bottom corner rather
than a widened gap, so the between-tab gaps are back to `--roster-gap` and
the +12px is gone; the scrollport's start inset is the foot radius so the
All enclosure's left foot is not clipped. The band's top edge came back as
the strip's floor line — a `--bubble-line` background pixel across the
full width, BELOW every tab ("圆弧连接的整个 Agent 框上面的输入区，应该有一
条横着的淡淡的白线延伸"). Unlike the deleted round-3 hairline, the lit
enclosure breaks it with its fill and its feet turn into it, so it never
crosses under a tab. Chromium, dark and light, 1300px at 2x: solo, team
member, team and All each show one continuous stroke from side to floor.
The owner's 14:50 look ("竖线…对齐得不是很严谨"; "横线，粗细好像也不一样")
was right at a FRACTIONAL device scale, which 2x hides. The tab's straight
side stroke is pixel-snapped and the arc is not; at 1.25x and 1.5x the
snapped stroke landed up to one device pixel inside a foot that ended
exactly on it, and showed as a stub beside the arc down to the floor. The
foot box now reaches one pixel into the enclosure and fills it, and its
ring box is exactly the radius (`box-sizing: border-box` — without it the
1px border pushed the arc a pixel outward). The floor line was a
translucent `--bubble-line` over the dark frame while every enclosure
stroke lies over band fill: measured luminance 46 against 65 at the
junction, which reads as a thinner line. The floor line now lies on one
pixel of `--bubble-in` too. Probe columns at 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x and 2x: no
stub under the arc, floor line 65–67 against the tab edge's 65.
The owner's own screenshots (15:07, macOS desktop, a 2x display at about
1.4 UI zoom) still showed both arcs landing a pixel ABOVE the floor line,
the line running on under each foot, and a bright tick of side stroke
below the line at each lit edge. WebKit cannot run on this host, so the
cause was read off the pixels: the tick sat on the floor line's rows, so
the card's bottom was a pixel above the strip's — the card was CENTRED at
its 34px minimum in a strip that something had made taller. Now the tab
chain (`.tabs`, the group, the card) stretches to the strip's height in the
collapsed row, so a tab reaches the floor however tall the strip is; the
paint box ends AT the floor instead of 1px into the band, so its side
strokes cannot tick below the line; and the fill's overlap of the floor
line moved to a join layer of its own (`::after` on a tab and on All, the
group baseline on a lit team) — without it a fractional scale let part of
a row of floor line or frame through under the tab (Chromium: lum 37 at
1.5x, 27 at 1.25x, band 31; 31 with it). The strip's scrollport clips at
the floor, so no enclosure paints into the band. The filter mark is the
funnel the menu row wears, not a magnifier (owner: "沙漏过滤的样式"), and it
sits beside the marks column rather than in it — three stacked marks would
have exceeded the strip and grown it.

**The enclosure is ONE marker that travels** (owner, 2026-09-23 16:58: "点击
不同 Agent 的标签进行切换时，会看到好像先标了一个框，然后又闪过去了…切换的动
画不是很丝滑"; motion principle 14). Until then each card lit in place: its
fill and edge crossfaded on `--t-move` while its feet, its opaque floor and
the join popped in the first frame — a frame appearing, then the fill
catching up, which is the flash. Now the lit enclosure — fill, edge, both
feet and the join into the band — is one `.slide-pill.tab` inside `.tabs`,
placed by the shared `slideIndicator` (`ui/indicator.ts`, the same
mechanism as the rail and every segmented control) and gliding by
transform and width on `--t-move` from the old destination to the new one.
Its target is the lit card (`.acard.sel[data-agent]`), the lit team group
(`.roster-cluster.team-lit`) or, under All and while All previews, the
group's own extent (an inert `.tabs-extent` box), so a card, a team and All
are the same marker at a different width; a lit member of a group wears the
raised `--text2` contour through `.raised`, and only that colour crossfades.
The rule is `rosterMarker` (`hub.ts`), and it reads the same `namedGroup`
the markup does: a lit team down to one live member is drawn as that
member's plain card, so the marker goes to the card. Aiming it at the
team enclosure when no enclosure was drawn left the selection with no
highlight at all, because a lit card paints nothing of its own here
(#241, validator, 2026-09-27).
In the strip a lit card, team or All paints nothing of its own any more (the
hover wash stays on unlit cards, as in Chrome); the wrapped list keeps its
closed boxes per element, and the marker is unmounted there. The marker is
the LAST child of `.tabs` (the All tab stays its first) and sits under the
cards and over the group baseline: both are `z-index: -1` inside `.tabs`,
now a stacking context, and the marker comes later in the DOM, so the
baseline shows exactly where the marker is not. The measure is layout (offsets),
so the marker is not fooled by the press scale or the root zoom; its box is
integer offsets, up to half a pixel wider than the card, inside the gap.
Frames at a 2.5s tempo: card → card, card → team and team → All each show
one enclosure in flight with both feet, nothing popping.
**The silhouette is one path** (owner, 2026-09-27: "这个拐角还是不够连续 感觉
线错位了…这个拐角渲染的效果感觉不是很自然…用最标准的方式"). The marker's
outline had been assembled from four rasterisations — a bordered box for the
sides and top, a radial-gradient fill and a bordered ring per foot, and a
join layer — and they had to meet: the side border snaps to device pixels,
the ring's arc and the gradient's hard stop do not. A static probe of that
construction measured the floor line's ink dropping to 60% of the line
under the foot at 1x (a visible break) and to 50% at 1.5x. Now the
silhouette is Chrome's own construction: ONE SVG path, filled once with
`--bubble-in` and stroked once with `--card-line` (`.tab-shape`, drawn by
`hub/tab-shape.ts`). The stroke runs on half-pixel centres and meets the
floor row tangentially; the fill is the stroke offset half a pixel outward
(radius r+½ on the top corners, f−½ on the feet) and closed one pixel into
the band, so the translucent stroke lies on fill along its whole length,
as the floor line does. The radii remain the tokens (`--ui-radius-row`,
`--roster-foot-radius`), read from the element. A ResizeObserver redraws
the path from the box's layout size, which it reports after layout and
before paint on every frame of the width glide, so the outline never lags
the marker. The same probe, same colours: the floor line's ink is constant
across the join at 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x and 2x; the real Roster at 1.5x and 2x
shows one continuous line from floor to foot to side. The strip's
skeleton (three shimmering cards) shows only while there is nothing to
show — with the cards already rendered it sat in front of them on a room
switch (owner, 17:38: "Agent 卡片都已经渲染出来了，前面还有 3 个空的过渡动画"). Same day, the band
under the strip got equal air above and below the field (6px, was 10px
below; compact 3px, was 8px) and square lower corners — the band's sides
meet the sidebar and the drawer, and the rounded corner left a notch
against them ("左下角和右下角…两边的侧边栏应该都是直角…会有一个小缺口").
The owner's 09:38 report of a WHITE LINE while switching tabs exposed two
transient join faults. Chromium 152 at 390px measured the incoming bottom
inset at 6px immediately after selection, 3.14px after 64ms and -1px only
after 230ms; the outgoing tab retracted the other way while its bottom
border returned immediately. The 1px group baseline showed through for
the 200ms animation. The selected tab's joining geometry (inset and
corner radius) now switches immediately; only background and border colour
crossfade on `--t-move`. Colour alone would still fade the new tab's fill
from transparent and leak the group baseline. The collapsed, non-All
selected tab therefore owns an immediately opaque `--bubble-in` floor of
`--roster-gap` pixels (2px) INSIDE its own paint. It reaches the band in the
first frame while the rest of the fill fades; the group line neither
becomes a tray-wide rule nor needs a second covering layer. The frame
probe at 390px light: at 40ms the body was 7% opaque but the floor was
fully opaque; video pixel x187,y538 went from grey (97/96/99) straight
to bubble (239/238/243) with no intermediate line.
At 390px long names could bury the strip, so compact caps the team's
visible text width inside its 44px native button; its full name is in
ARIA/hover and each member's touch-opened menu. Expanded mode is a list:
the pill stays and a selected team closes its group border rather than
pretending to join the band. Under All selection/preview both group line
and contour yield to one destinations enclosure. Member cards keep
independent native selection/Stop targets. Stopped
identities remain outside `.tabs`. The wrapper scrolls as one item and
wraps members when expanded. A new member appears with `appear-pop`;
group/member reorders use the one `animate:flip` tempo; removal and a
one-to-two-member group chrome change cut.

### One team selection, exact member delivery (#239, 2026-09-23)

Owner: "如果是一个 team 的话，我点击 team 的名称，可以一次性选中该
team 的这几个 Agent". The label is a real button, not an `@all` disguise:
`team:<root>` is a frontend-only recipient value (the colon cannot occur
in an agent window name). The single `targetMembers` resolver reads the
managed roster's recorded `team` path; `dev` includes `dev/review`, never
a solo window or another team. It drives the pressed cards, composer
destination, message addresses and busy/interrupt membership. Clicking an
individual card narrows to one; clicking All broadens to everyone. A team
group is the ONE selected enclosure, so internal card borders turn off.
The terminal partition follows an agent only, never the team sentinel.

A chat send takes one snapshot of current member names, prefixes each
with the server's existing `@name` token and posts ONE room message;
explicit body mentions remain additive and `@all` is never synthesized.
If the team empties in the gap before the next roster poll, implicit
delivery keeps the draft and clears the stale team target; an explicit
valid `@name` in the text still wins and goes through unchanged.
There is no new server route. A leading CLI `/command` under team
selection is typed verbatim through one existing `hub_command` per current
member, like All's existing broadcast route; a leading explicit `@name`
still wins. Partial command success leaves the cleared draft alone so a
retry cannot duplicate commands already typed; if every call fails, the
draft is restored. Both cases now use the shared `OperationFeedback`
anchored to the composer's field: a partial failure names only the members
who did NOT receive `/command`, and an all-failed error names the command.
No raw transport exception reaches the screen. Errors persist until
dismissed, the next command, recipient change or room change; the local
feedback lifetime invalidates stale async outcomes. A remembered team
selection stays while at least one
member survives; when the last departs the recipient becomes an explicit
room note, not a silently selected agent elsewhere. The group label
stays a native 28px pointer / 44px coarse target in collapsed and expanded
lists. The visible compact name may elide, but its full accessible name
and the member's touch menu retain the identity.

One shared icon-only CommandButton expands the same keyed list in normal
flow. The default is one horizontal row; expansion uses 1/2/4 columns and
internal scrolling, capped at `min(240px, 32dvh / --ui-zoom)`. Long names wrap
in expanded cells instead of clipping. Both selection and Stop retain native
28px pointer / 44px coarse targets; the Stop track remains reserved when idle.
The disclosure chevron uses the existing `.flip` atom through controlled
`expanded`, never a second glyph or animation. `hubPrefs.rosterExpanded` stores
the mode per project and follows project rename like the drawer preference.
Hub captures project and next mode before its existing `withReadingAnchor`
transaction; this is not a popup or new Back/history layer.

While a card is pointed at, pressed or focused, hold the display order but
read current agent objects for state and actions. Remove departed names and
append new members; adopt the latest turn order on pointerleave/blur/release,
not a timer. An idle expanded view reorders live: freezing until collapse
would hide new activity (lead clarification, 08:04). Keyed `flip` uses
`moveMs()` for that reorder, not a new timing curve. A new Stop must not move
under an active gesture. Pointer-up/lost capture releases the press lock even
when a disabled target emits no click.
Relevant DOM updates recheck actual focus because removing a Stop or agent
does not guarantee a `focusout` event.

Each busy card exposes a sibling Stop button, not a nested selection button.
`busyTargetsFor` in `hub-composer.ts` is the sole membership decision:
running/working/waiting/blocked managed agents only; everyone includes only
busy members, no selection includes none. Both that button and empty-composer
double Ctrl+C call the same Hub dispatcher. The dispatcher captures room and
names before awaiting, prevents overlapping requests for a member, and cleans
up only its own jobs. A peer Stop never changes recipient, opens/retargets a
drawer or forces the feed to its tail. Existing server push/poll reads the
reset-first state and `[tmm] interrupted <name>` line; no optimistic status
store is added. Process kill/remove remain separate consequential menu verbs.

The keyboard can do no more than the visible Stop: two non-repeated Ctrl+C
presses within three seconds, only with an empty composer and no text
selection. Text, room or recipient changes and Escape reset that sequence;
native copy and IME composition remain untouched. It has no send-button
arming state, timer or caption. Send only sends and is disabled while empty,
uploading or blocked by a failed attachment.

The delayed 260ms card menu, double-click filter shortcut, recipient popup
and two-beat send-button mechanism are removed whole. Secondary agent verbs
use `ContextMenu` with `longpress`; stopped slots open that menu, never select
an undeliverable destination. Only the command palette remains a Composer
Back layer. The textarea and attach/send row are normal flow, so the old
recipient indent, last-line mirror and corner-collision padding are gone.
Actual shell-height changes still notify Hub through the existing reading
boundary; no animated height, new scroll mechanism or lifecycle remount.

The pre-#168 descriptions below of the chip, mirror, recipient menu and
two-beat button are historical evidence, not alternate supported controls.
Delivery parsing, attachment gates and readline rules are unchanged.

Verification on Node 22.23.2 / Svelte 5.55.5 / Vite 6.4.2: pure target
vectors plus the mounted real Hub pin selection, body mentions, busy-only
Stop, keyboard parity, duplicate requests and room identity across awaits.
Negative controls remove the managed gate (reaches a shell) and make Stop
select its target (changes Alice to Bob); both fail their tests. Seven retained
Hub transport/staging/reading functions are AST-identical to the #171 base.
Chromium 152 checks desktop and 390px light/dark, explicit coarse media,
long names, nested teams, menu/Stop reach, reload, reduced motion and a
reduced-height multiline input. Settled history typing and peer Stop preserve
the reference row within 1px. Tests wait for the existing 300ms focus-tail
callback before beginning a history transaction; racing that separate callback
is not evidence of a composer-growth defect. Synthetic touch and key checks
do not replace native Android keyboard/IME acceptance.

### The room has a default recipient

**Explicit broadcast restoration** (board #171, 2026-09-11): a stored
`ALL_TARGET` is a destination mode, not an agent name to look up. `pickLead`
preserves it before inspecting the roster, exactly like the stored empty
string. This deliberately keeps broadcast selected through an empty/direct-only
roster; it neither delivers nor interrupts anything. With null/absent preference,
the existing managed-lead rule still applies, and an empty roster yields `''`.
The bug was in this classification, not localStorage: a stored `"all"` failed
the agent-name lookup and silently became the first lead on reload or revisit.
The single `ALL_TARGET` constant comes from `hub-composer.ts`; no new sentinel
or preference migration. Unit vectors cover zero/one/many/direct-only rosters;
a mounted real Hub covers fresh-client restore, cached-room return and polling
with post/command/interrupt RPCs forbidden. The chip's former "three states"
description below omits broadcast; this dated rule corrects that omission.

`pickLead()` (pure, client) = remembered choice while present → the only managed agent → lowest window (the `can_hire` seat was retired 2026-09-26); choosing a recipient IS choosing the project lead, so it persists per session — and the ROOM is a choice too: `hubPrefs.lead` has three states (a name, `""` = the user chose "no recipient, record only", `null` = nobody chose), `pickLead` keeps an explicit `""`, and only `null` seats a lead; before, `""` was stored as an absent key and the next 5 s roster poll re-seated a lead the user had just dismissed (review C, 2026-09-03; `hub-prefs.test.ts` + `pickLead` tests pin it) — and `addressed()` ALWAYS prefixes the chip's `@name` (owner, 2026-08-26: "前边的永远保留，后边的at如果存在某人的话也会发送过去" — an `@` in the body used to stand the chip down, so an email address or quoted @all silently defeated the chosen recipient); body @mentions deliver TOO because `deliver_mentions` scans the whole body, and only a body already leading with the same recipient skips the prefix (empty recipient = the whole room). **The chip SAYS so, live** (review, 2026-09-03: it read `to: alice` while `@bob` in the body was delivered as well, with no hint): `chipExtras(text, recipient, managedNames)` (pure + tested, on the same `mentionTokens` tokenizer as `mentionsAgent` and the feed's room-note verdict — never a second parser) appends `+@bob` for every managed agent the body addresses beyond the recipient, in roster order; an `@all` in the body collapses to `+@all` rather than listing the roster, `@all` as the recipient appends nothing (already everyone), and a name that resolves to nobody on the roster — an email address, a removed agent, a direct window — is not shown because it is not delivered. The extras wear the accent even on the grey room-note chip, because that part IS a delivery, and the chip's tooltip switches to name them. An empty room shows a preset start (one agent, or several as a team) rather than a composer with nobody to talk to — but "empty" is a VERDICT, not a default: switching projects parks the leaving room in an in-memory per-session cache (`roomCache`: feed, activity, roster, cursors) and restores it instantly on return, and a room without a cache entry renders NOTHING until its first `hub_log` answers (`roomReady`); judging emptiness from the cleared arrays made every switch flash the "add an agent" panel in front of rooms full of history (owner, 2026-08-25: "先看到添加 agent 一个 agent list那个页面闪了一下，然后再出来消息"). The pollers merge on top of the restored state (cached `lastTs` makes the refresh incremental), a cached roster seats the recipient immediately via the same `pickLead`, and entering a room always lands at its tail. The verdict rule swept the other pages too (owner, 2026-08-25: "不同页面切换会不会有类似的这种问题"): the Terminal sidebar says "No sessions" only after its first refresh answered (`listReady`) and renders the untracked group only after Projects reported `onTracked` once (`trackedReady` — before that every tracked session flashed as untracked and migrated; `Projects.load` now reports on its failure path too, so the gate cannot stay shut), and the Agents page keeps last-known defs/skills/MCP on a failed reload instead of wiping them. Files (`!entries.length && !loading`) and Team (`loading` gate) were already correct. DirPicker navigates the same way (owner, 2026-08-28: "每次点击一个路径…先清空再重新刷新…要交互更流畅"): a tap KEEPS the current list and swaps it atomically when `fs_list` answers (`seq` makes the newest tap win; scrollTop resets on the swap because a new directory starts at its top); the `…` placeholder shows only before the FIRST answer, a failed listing keeps the old rows with the error line above, and the busy cue is a 150ms-delayed opacity dim so a fast local listing never blinks.

### Three ways a message lands, and they are not shades of one thing

a name (the default lead) types into ONE agent's input; `@all` types into EVERY managed agent's input, so every agent starts a turn at once; no recipient records it in the room and interrupts NOBODY (agents see it at their next `tmm log`). The third was once labelled "everyone", which was exactly backwards — it is the one that reaches nobody live.

### A `/command` goes to the CLI, not to the model

`/model`, `/clear`, `/compact` are interpreted by the agent's TUI and only as a whole line, so `hub_command` types them VERBATIM into the pane — no `[tmm chat …] human:` stamp, no @address (owner, 2026-08-19). `slashCommand()` (pure + tested) requires the first token to be `/word` with NO second slash, so `/tmp/foo` and `/usr/bin/env node` stay messages; it needs a target (explicit `@name`, else the composer's recipient, `@all` = every managed agent) and falls back to an ordinary message when there is none; managed windows only (a `/clear` typed into a SHELL would run as a path); and the room records it as a `[tmm] ` lifecycle line, never a message, so the mention scanner cannot feed it back.

### The `/` palette is transcribed, not invented

`KIRO_COMMANDS` (`hub.ts`) carries kiro-cli's own names/descriptions/sub-commands copied from its TUI table — a made-up command looks authoritative in the list and then does nothing in the pane — minus cloud-only/hidden entries, with `/quit` last.

**Only commands that DO something are offered**: kiro's `inputType: "panel"` ones (plus those that open $EDITOR or a recorder) would park the agent inside a view nobody here can see or dismiss, so `/tools`, `/help`, `/mcp`, `/context`, `/code`… carry `view: true` — they stay in the table WITH the reason and `OFFERED_COMMANDS` filters them out (owner, 2026-08-19); re-enabling one is deleting a flag. Ten remain, and `/agent` offers only `swap` because create/edit open an editor.

**The palette speaks the ADDRESSEE's dialect** (2026-08-22): `offeredCommands(backend)` picks the table by the explicit `@name`'s backend, else the recipient — `GROK_COMMANDS` (transcribed from grok 1.0.5's own docs; its `/model` completes inline since grok models enumerate) and `CODEX_COMMANDS` (transcribed live from codex 0.148.0's `/` popup; there `/model`/`/permissions`/`/review` are PICKERS = views, and `/delete` is flagged destructive, never offered); claude gets NO palette yet (its `/` popup is still untranscribed) and `@all` over a mixed roster none either. `commandPalette()` (pure + tested) decides stage/items/replace-slice: `/` → commands, `/model ` → its values (fetched via `models_list` PER BACKEND, the same call the agent editor uses), and only the LAST token + FIRST argument are completed because what follows one is a path or free text. Matching is FUZZY in three strict tiers — prefix, substring, subsequence (`fuzzyRank`, pure + tested; stable table order within a tier) — so `/mdl` finds `/model` and `son` finds `claude-sonnet-4.5` (owner, 2026-08-24: "不一定从第一个字符开始匹配"), while Enter stays safe because a looser match never outranks a tighter one (`/co` still means `/compact`). The palette owns ↑↓/Tab/Enter while open, Escape dismisses until the text changes, hover and the keyboard cursor share ONE highlight. The composer SPEAKS READLINE: Ctrl-A/E/U/K/W/Y/D/H/T/F/B via `readlineEdit()` (pure + tested) — one kill buffer, consecutive kills accumulate (backward prepends), any other key breaks the chain, A/E are line-scoped, Ctrl-K at line end joins, empty-buffer Ctrl-Y is a handled no-op (Chromium's default is REDO), Ctrl-C/V/X/Z fall through to the browser; the caret is set after Svelte writes the value back. A command-shaped draft STYLES the composer (accent-tinted capsule, tool-lane monospace) via `composerIsCmd`, which mirrors send()'s branch exactly; the measuring mirror flips font with the input in ONE rule, and `growComposer` re-measures on the flip (a font change rewraps).

### Pure composer decisions (board #117, 2026-09-09)

`hub-composer.ts` owns palette-backend selection, `ALL_TARGET`, attachment
token spelling and body substitution; #168 adds the pure busy-target
selector described above. The original helpers were closure-local calculations;
parameterizing them adds executing boundary tests without changing behavior.
The selector still requires a managed target, keeps unknown targets empty,
and offers a shared dialect only when the managed roster has exactly one.
Substitution replaces the first matching token, appends missing-token
references in attachment order, and retains `String.replace` semantics.
The existing command/mention/readline parsers and command tables stay in
`hub.ts`; Hub keeps `send()`, staging and both send gates. Board #133 moves
the view-owned state and DOM as described below.

The mounted Hub test holds a file upload unresolved, presses Enter and
observes no post; after upload it observes the complete addressed body.
Removing the actual `attaching` guard is the negative control. This proves
the event-to-send path, not native clipboard behavior or layout.

### Historical extraction characterization (board #133, 2026-09-09)

Before moving the view, the mounted Hub characterizes readline caret after
settling, kill-buffer and draft lifetime across rooms, palette focus, all
three delivery destinations, compact/Shift/IME Enter, the mixed button/key
interrupt pair and its 3-second expiry/disarm rules. Deferred RPC replies
cover overlapping upload generations, failed chips and post/command rollback
across a room switch. The existing upload/Enter and Back tests stay unchanged.
These execute the real handlers but do not simulate clipboard insertion or
layout. Chromium 152.0.7977.64 separately captures the real view at 1440x900
and 390x844, light/dark and reduced-motion spots: short and overflowing text,
command mirror font, measured recipient indent, both menus and file chips.

The receipt and recipient menu share the dashed `.note-dot` in
`hub-atoms.css`, beside their shared `.st` box. Its former scoped declaration
is relocated once, with the same two-class specificity and restricted parent
selectors, so extracting the Composer does not duplicate it or restyle
embedded Files/Terminal/Board content.

### Historical view ownership (board #133, 2026-09-09; superseded by #168)

`Composer.svelte` owns the capsule, textarea/mirror sizing, paste/key adapters,
palette/model cache, readline kill buffer, recipient popover and interrupt
arm/timer. It is unkeyed and lives as long as Hub: changing rooms does not
reset the kill buffer or model cache. Private CSS moves with its markup;
compact ancestor selectors cross the Svelte boundary at the same specificity.

Hub still owns the draft binding, recipient/preference writes, attachment
generation/jobs/pending set, staging, `send()` and every RPC. Composer receives
explicit state and commands, not a Hub store or feed/roster DOM references.
The named `caret`/`focus` methods replace staging's two textarea accesses;
height/focus intents retain the original parent tail behavior. Thumbnail
preview passes the original local object URL to Hub's existing Lightbox.

Composer registers only recipient/palette/interrupt with the existing fixed
Back registry and disposes those registrations on unmount. The capture-phase
listeners remain in Hub in their original order; their Composer portions
delegate to live child methods, not copied open flags. Parent recipient
selection still closes the picker and disarms synchronously. No browser
history listener, new dismissal mechanism or RPC race fix is part of this move.

Verification on Svelte 5.53.5 / Vite 6.4.1 / Node 22.23.2: seven moved
handlers and `send()` are AST-identical; staging/growth differ only by their
named boundary calls; all 73 moved CSS rule bodies match. Chromium
152.0.7977.64 produced 54 identical text/rect/computed-style signatures
across the six variants. The font-mirror negative control removed only the
mirror's command-font selector: its tail marker moved from (552.58, 849.5)
to (983.13, 809), failing the geometry assertion. The selector was restored.
The restored build passes that assertion again. Two additional desktop/compact
long-recipient signatures also match; real PNG paste stages a thumbnail whose
original local URL opens in the existing Lightbox in both layouts.

### Words beside a picture of the words: the text is the paste (2026-09-08)

The paste door's rule was "files win over co-riding text" (board #25) — right for a Finder/Explorer file copy, whose text is the file's own path, and for a screenshot, which has no text. It was wrong for the paste the owner met daily: PowerPoint (and Word, Excel, Keynote, Numbers, every browser) puts a **PNG rendering of the selection** on the clipboard beside `text/plain`/`text/html`, and the composer staged the picture and threw the words away ("从 ppt 上粘贴过来的文字，总是被粘贴为了一个图片"). `textIsThePaste(text, files)` (hub.ts, pure, tested) now decides before `preventDefault`: the text wins when it is non-empty AND every file is an image AND the text is not one token that is a URL, a path, or the name of one of the files. Every legitimate file paste fails that test — a screenshot carries no text, a file copy carries its own name/path, a web "Copy image" carries at most the image URL, and any non-image file (a pdf beside a caption) is a file paste whatever the text says. When the text wins the handler simply returns and the textarea's default insertion runs; the rendering is dropped, not staged — nobody wants a picture of a bullet list next to the bullet list. The HTML flavour is ignored on purpose: the composer is plain text and markdown, and Office HTML is a wall of styling.

### An attachment failure is a chip, never a console line

The staging pipeline (`stageFiles` — the `+` button and paste share it; the reference rule and the upload layout are in `hub-feed.md` §An image is a reference) used to `console.warn` an oversized file (`FILE_CAP`, 32 MB per RPC) or a failed upload and carry on, so the user could not tell what the message was about to carry (review, 2026-09-03). Now every failure is a `pending` entry like any other attachment — `failedAttachment(file, reason)`: no path, no token, no number, an `error` — rendered in the file chip's own clothes turned to the danger tone (`.pend-chip.err`: `--status-danger` ink + border + 8% wash, name + reason, tooltip with the whole reason, ✕ removes it). Three failures land there: too large (before any upload — with the hint to point the agent at the path instead), a per-file throw (the loop is per FILE now, so one bad file does not take the others down), and the uploads dir itself failing (every file of that job). A failed chip is not content (`sendable` counts only staged ones) and it BLOCKS send while it stands — `send()` returns and the button is disabled with `Remove the failed attachment first` — the same two-gate rule `attaching` follows, because a message that quietly left without the file it showed is the failure mode this exists to prevent. The staleness discipline holds: a throw comes out of an await, so the catch checks `stale()` before touching the room (as a guard, not a return, so the loop goes on); the source test pins one check per await unchanged, plus this test's own three chips and the two gates.

### Interrupt is a third verb, and only the pane can carry it

typing `Escape` into the agent's own pane (`hub_agent_interrupt` server-side so the UI and CLI share ONE implementation; `send_keys`, NAMED key — with `extended-keys on` tmux drops raw C0 bytes) is the only way to cancel a turn that is ALREADY running; a `tmm`/chat message is read between turns by definition, and stop/restart kill or bounce the process.

**The derived state is RESET FIRST, then the key is typed** (`telemetry::record_interrupt`: `end = ("completed", now)`, `ask` and the explicit claim cleared → `derive` says `idle` immediately), and the order is the whole point (owner, 2026-08-29): a turn cancelled from OUTSIDE has no edge of its own — no stop hook fires for it — so the newest fact would stay the `userPromptSubmit` that opened it and the card would read `running` for as long as the agent lived; and an interrupted agent usually gets something else to do within seconds, whose own turn re-derives `running`, so a reset racing that new turn is indistinguishable from no reset at all — an interrupt that looks like it never landed. Clearing `explicit` is part of it: a `blocked` claim from the dead turn outranks the end in `derive_from` when they share a second. So the Hub's agent action bar carries Watch / Interrupt / Stop, in rising order of consequence.

**The composer carries it too, behind two beats** (owner, 2026-08-24): with the box EMPTY the grey send button is still clickable — the first tap ARMS it ("send interrupt": amber, a caption pill naming the target since a phone has no hover) and the second fires; double Ctrl+C on the empty composer is the same arm/fire pair (with text present Ctrl+C stays the browser's copy, which `readlineEdit` deliberately falls through to).

**While the recipient is mid-turn the resting button says so**: a stop square inside a slowly circling arc (2.2s — a fast spin says "loading", this says "a turn is open"; accent on the resting grey, `prefers-reduced-motion` stills it), the glyph every chat product speaks — the armed state keeps the same glyph on the amber ground, because the earlier `zap` bolt read as nothing ("我看打断是闪电，看着好像不是那么容易理解", owner 2026-08-25). Busy means the hook-derived running/working/waiting/blocked of the recipient (any managed agent for `@all`); idle and failed show the plain grey arrow — an ended turn has nothing to interrupt. The interrupt reaches whoever the composer reaches — the recipient, or every managed agent for `@all`; an unaddressed room note arms nothing. Armed state stands down by itself: 3 s, typing, Escape, or switching projects. And the room now RECORDS the act — `hub_agent_interrupt` posts `[tmm] interrupted <name>` (the sys grammar already spoke it: amber, a turn cut short), so the feed shows what the app did ("发送 interrupt 的状态在消息列表里也要展示出来"); a real-tmux test pins window-survives + room-line.

### Historical composer motion (before #168)

Per [motion.md](motion.md). The recipient chip's arrow is ONE chevron in `.flip` — up while closed (the menu opens upward), turned down while open — never two glyphs swapped (principle 4, the owner's own example). `+@bob` fades in (`.appear`); attachment chips and thumbs pop in (`.appear-pop`; the list is keyed by `a.key`, but its three chip species sit under an `{#if}`, so there is no `animate:flip`); the interrupt caption rises (`.appear-rise`); the send glyph pops when the `{#if}` swaps arrow ↔ stop-square — unrelated glyphs may swap. The recipient menu and the `/` palette are placed popovers like every other (principle 8, wave 6): each wears `.pop-layer` with `bind:clientHeight` as its `.ready` gate and `--pop-origin: bottom left` — the corner touching the chip, since both open upward — so it is measured invisible, then grows from the chip on `--t-fast`; the height resets when the menu closes so every opening is measured (and animated) again, and the atom touches only opacity/transform/pointer-events, so their own `position: absolute; bottom: calc(100% + 6px)` placement is untouched and the rest state is `transform: none`. Exits are cuts. **Hover** (principle 16): resting on the recipient chip opens the one hover card with a sentence for the CURRENT destination in the three-destination model — `@name` types into one pane, `@all` into every managed pane, no recipient records only — with the body's `+@` extras as its note; the chip carries no native `title` any more. The composer's height is JS-measured per keystroke and never animated.
