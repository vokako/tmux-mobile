# File Browser Page

## Purpose
Browse, preview, edit, and manage files on the remote server's filesystem. The
File Browser is always available (it does not require an open terminal pane).
The starting directory follows the active terminal/team session's working
directory, or the server's home directory when no session is open yet.

## Components
- Unified toolbar: named shared icon controls, 28px pointer / 44px coarse
  native targets with compact inset paint. Keep one row; measured overflow
  exposes trailing actions through the shared More menu, without shrinking
  touch targets or removing actions.
  Its first control
  (terminal glyph, "Session directory") returns to the active session's
  working directory; it is NOT a home button — the house icon means the
  user's home (`~`) wherever it appears (the directory picker)
- Breadcrumb path row (separate from toolbar): headed by the browser pair, Back and Forward (arrow glyphs, 28/44 targets) — Back retraces the user's directory steps, Forward undoes a Back, each disabled at its end, a fresh navigation clears Forward; the crumb strip scrolls to its tail; the root reads as the first separator; a segment's text is selectable, and right-click / long-press offers Copy path of that segment; file names in the list are selectable too, and a tap that ends a selection does not open or navigate
- File/directory list with icons, size, modified date
- The desktop list uses the available width until a preview is open. Beside a
  preview its independent, resizable width defaults to 400px (320-520px), not
  the global navigation sidebar width. File sizes sit to the right of complete
  names, on the same row; ordinary file and folder rows share a height.
- Bookmark panel (star current dir, scrollable saved paths)
- Recent files panel (last 20 opened files, scrollable, capped to 40vh)
- File preview: Markdown (rendered through the shared safe renderer, `core/markdown.ts`, + mermaid + KaTeX), CSV (table), code (syntax highlighted; the lined view shows the first 3000 lines with a "Show all N lines" button), HTML (sandboxed iframe), PDF (pdf.js), images (tap → the fullscreen Lightbox with pinch/wheel zoom; a trackpad pinch on the inline image opens it instead of zooming the page), video (the browser's own `<video>` player streaming ranges from the signed `/dl` URL — mp4/m4v/webm/mov/mkv/ogv, any size). pdf.js, mermaid and highlight.js load on first use, not at startup.
- Text editor with syntax highlighting, undo stack, save button
- File operations: create file/folder, rename, delete, upload, download
- File info panel: path (tap to copy), type, size, modified, permissions
- Git integration: status view, per-file stage/unstage, diff viewer, commit log, add all/commit/push

## Interactions
- Tap directory → navigate into it
- Tap file → preview (or info page if not previewable, or if file size > 5 MB and the kind is not streamed — video streams at any size)
- Tap a path reference in chat, Markdown, converted content, or an HTML
  preview → open it in Files, with the target's parent listing and a Back
  route to the source preview/list. Relative paths resolve against the
  project (chat) or source document's directory (previews), never the web origin.
- Explicit HTTP(S) and protocol-relative web links open in the system browser
  (a separate tab in browser mode); never navigate the app WebView.
- Desktop left-click, Cmd/Ctrl-click and middle-click share this destination
  policy: paths stay inside Files; real web URLs open externally.
- Background/resume and WebSocket reconnect refresh directory data without closing the active preview or editor
- From info page → tap preview (eye) button to load preview on demand
- Long file names wrap, preserving whitespace, rather than hiding behind a
  horizontal scroller. Preview titles also wrap without displacing Back/tools.
- Tap edit → open text editor
- Leaving an editor with unsaved changes asks "Discard unsaved changes?" on
  EVERY exit — the back button/gesture, a session or pane switch, the
  follow-the-cwd move, and the Hub drawer's "look here" jump. Cancel keeps the
  editor; a cancelled programmatic move (cwd follow) is skipped for that
  event, not replayed later
- Desktop right-click / long-press on a row → shared actions for that entry.
  Blank-directory context and toolbar More reuse toolbar actions; a menu
  cannot act on a different entry after navigation. Info remains available
  through the preview's existing info action.
- Menu Open and row Open both protect an unsaved editor. Menu Delete still
  requires confirmation; Back closes the menu before leaving the current view.
- Star button → bookmark current directory
- Hidden-file and bookmark tools expose pressed state; bookmark/recent panels
  expose expanded state and an associated panel ID. An opened empty panel
  distinguishes loading, read failure/retry and a confirmed empty collection.
- New item opens a name field and the shared File/Folder segmented choice.
- Refresh button in the toolbar → re-list current directory
- Swipe right from left edge → go back
- The back gesture retraces the user's own directory path first (a history,
  not a parent walk); below it a tab visit climbs parent directories to `/`
  and then stays (board #47 — the terminal is not below Files). Only a visit
  jumped from the chat returns to the conversation instead.
- Upload button → file picker (Tauri on desktop/Android, `<input>` in browser)
- Download button → save file locally

## API Calls
- `fs_cwd(session)` — get session working directory
- `fs_list(path, show_hidden)` — list directory
- `fs_stat(path)` — file metadata
- `fs_read(path)` — read text file (≤512KB)
- `fs_write(path, content)` — save text file
- `fs_mkdir(path)` — create directory
- `fs_delete(path)` — delete file/directory
- `fs_rename(from, to)` — rename/move
- `fs_download(path)` — download as base64 (≤50MB)
- `fs_upload(path, data)` — upload as base64
- `fs_convert(path, format?)` — convert file to HTML for preview (currently pptx only; extracted natively by the server, no external tooling required)
- `git(subcmd, args, cwd)` — git operations
- `get_bookmarks()` / `save_bookmarks(bookmarks)` — bookmark persistence

## State Management
- Current path, directory listing
- Preview content and mode (markdown/csv/code/html/pdf/image)
- Editor content, unsaved changes flag, undo stack
- Bookmarks array (server-side persistence)
- Show hidden files toggle
- Git status, diff, log data

### Bookmarks / recent-files write discipline
Both lists persist whole-array last-writer-wins (`save_bookmarks`,
`set_pref('recentFiles')`) and RPCs are concurrent, so the client guards
against clobbering (`src/lib/files/Files.svelte`):
1. Never persist before the first successful load (a write of the default
   `[]` would erase the server list); if the lazy load fails, skip
   persisting rather than wipe.
2. Every local mutation bumps a generation counter; fetch continuations
   only assign if their generation is still current — an in-flight read
   must not overwrite a newer local mutation.
3. The lazy first load is single-flighted (one shared promise).
These are client-side guards only; two *different* clients can still race
(server-side merge semantics would be the deeper fix — see todo.md §F).

Both rules are implemented once in `src/lib/files/persisted-list.ts`
(unit-tested); bookmarks and recents are two configurations of it.

## Edge Cases
- Base64 upload uses chunked encoding (8192 bytes/chunk) to avoid stack overflow
- Files > 5 MB (or not previewable by mime/name) open the info page instead of auto-loading preview; user confirms via preview button to avoid heavy transfers on mobile
- Markdown preview resolves relative image paths, infers MIME from image extension (not parent file)
- Markdown preview escapes raw HTML in the file (a README's `<img onerror>` is text, not script); inline HTML badges/logos therefore show as source
- A text file over 3000 lines previews its head; "Show all N lines" renders the rest (one DOM row per line — the cap keeps a 512 KB log from freezing a phone)
- Code highlighting arrives after the first-use load of highlight.js; the lines are readable (escaped, unhighlighted) in the meantime
- HTML preview iframe: `allow-same-origin` only, NO `allow-scripts` (sandbox escape prevention)
- HTML preview installs parent-owned path and external handlers in the sandbox
  document, since iframe click events cannot reach App
- Android downloads go to `/storage/emulated/0/Download/TmuxMobile/`, opened via FileProvider + Intent
- Android's downloaded-files list is sorted by filesystem modification time descending (newest first)
- Download feedback uses the shared presentation; a measured transfer reports
  an integer byte percentage, while unknown totals and writing are indeterminate
  (#167, 2026-09-12). No synthetic percentage or delayed completion flash.
- A native saved-file result keeps Open/Close until acted on or its context
  exits; a browser download request uses the ordinary short completion notice
  without claiming the file was saved.
- Android file opening uses the `AndroidFileOpener` JS interface injected before initial page load by `onWebViewCreate`, NOT `tauri-plugin-opener`
- Android reattaches and health-checks the file opener after app resume; a failed download-complete Open remains retryable
- Filenames sanitized server-side (`sanitize_filename()`) to prevent path traversal
- Failed transfers leave pending state and expose their error; a stale
  completion cannot replace the feedback for a newer operation or context.
- Git arguments are passed directly as argv, not through a shell; log format separators such as `|` are valid argument data
- Every git verb (stage, unstage, add all, commit, push) reports its outcome in the same 3-second banner under the panel header; a failure shows `✗ ` + git's stderr (or the exit code when stderr is empty) — a failing stage never looks like a button that did nothing
