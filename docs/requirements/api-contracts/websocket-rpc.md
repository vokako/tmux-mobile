# WebSocket JSON-RPC API Contract

## Transport
JSON-RPC over WebSocket (`ws://` or `wss://`).

## Authentication

### Encrypted Auth (default, when Web Crypto available)
```
← {"server_nonce": "<hex>", "e2e": 2}                // nonce + newest handshake version
→ {"method": "auth", "params": {"client_nonce": "<hex>", "proof": "<hex>", "e2e": 2}}
← <binary AES-GCM frame: {"result": {"authenticated": true, "machine_id", "hostname", "e2e": 2}}>
```
- IKM = token, salt = server_nonce ‖ client_nonce (16 + 16 bytes), HKDF-SHA256, 32-byte outputs
- **v2** (current) derives THREE keys, one per job, by `info` label:
  `tmux-mobile-e2e/v2/proof` (HMAC proof key), `tmux-mobile-e2e/v2/c2s`
  (client→server AES-256-GCM key), `tmux-mobile-e2e/v2/s2c` (server→client key)
- **v1** (legacy) derives ONE key with `info` = `tmux-mobile-e2e` and uses it as
  proof key and as the cipher key in both directions. Both directions counting
  from 0 under one key meant client message #n and server message #n shared a
  (key, nonce) pair — the AES-GCM nonce-reuse failure. Kept only so peers that
  predate v2 still connect.
- Negotiation: the server advertises `e2e` in the nonce frame; the client asks
  for a version in its auth params; the server derives with the version the
  CLIENT asked for (no field = v1) and echoes it in the authenticated result. An
  old client never sends `e2e` and gets v1; a new client against an old server
  sees no `e2e` in the nonce frame and uses v1.
- Proof: HMAC-SHA256(proof_key, server_nonce ‖ client_nonce) — both nonces, so a
  captured proof cannot be replayed into a later handshake
- All subsequent messages are binary AES-256-GCM frames; nonce = 4 zero bytes ‖ big-endian u64 counter
- Decrypted payload starts with a one-byte framing tag: raw UTF-8 JSON or raw-deflate JSON (compression is used only when it reduces payload size)
- Each direction uses its own monotonic counter; clients must serialize encrypted sends so wire order matches nonce order
- Server and client derivations are pinned to shared test vectors
  (`src-tauri/src/server/wire.rs` tests ↔ `src/lib/core/ws.test.ts`)

### Legacy Plain Auth (fallback, no Web Crypto)
```
← {"server_nonce": "<hex>"}
→ {"method": "auth", "params": {"token": "..."}}
← {"result": {"authenticated": true, "machine_id": "uuid", "hostname": "my-mac"}}
```

### Rate Limiting
- Max auth failures tracked per IP
- Lockout after repeated failures (configurable timeout)

## Methods

### Session Management
| Method | Params | Response |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `ping` | — | `"pong"`. Used by the client's idle probe to detect half-open links. |
| `list_sessions` | — | Array of `{name, windows, attached, created, last_opened?}` objects. `last_opened` is unix seconds of the last time this session was opened via tmux-mobile (`subscribe` RPC); absent if never opened. The scratch terminal's session is omitted while it is ours (`scratch::hidden_session`, board #326 — its panel is its only door); a plain session or a project holding that name is listed normally. |
| `list_panes` | `session` | Array of pane objects: `{session, window, pane, width, height, current_command, window_name, pane_title, current_path, active, child_cmd?, agent?}`. `current_path` is tmux `#{pane_current_path}`; `active` marks the window's active pane; `child_cmd` is the foreground descendant argv, omitted for bare shells; `agent` is the backend name (`kiro`, `claude`, `codex`, `grok`, `omp`, `kimi`, `openclaw`) the pane's PROCESSES run, derived by the server from the NAME of each process on the pane's chain (argv[0]'s file name, plus the script's file name when argv[0] is an interpreter such as `node`; the one path read is Claude's `…/claude/versions/<version>` binary) — never from other arguments, directories, `pane_title` or `window_name` — and omitted for anything else. Clients read `agent`; they do not re-derive it (board #260). `list_sessions_with_panes` carries the same pane objects. |
| `list_sessions_with_panes` | — | `{sessions, panes}` — the two lists above in one round-trip (saves 1+N RPCs on the Sessions page). Hides the owned scratch session through the same one predicate, from the sessions AND from the panes. |
| `new_session` | `name?`, `path?`, `command?` | OK |
| `kill_session` | `name` | OK |
| `scratch_session` | — | `{session, target}` — ensures the scratch terminal's session (board #324: `tmm-scratch`, in `$HOME`, marked `@tmm-scratch=1`, never a project) and answers its first window's first pane as `session:window.pane`, always a LIVE one: #326 applies the keep-alive (`remain-on-exit` + a `pane-died: respawn-pane -k` hook) and respawns a pane that is already dead, never one that is running; refuses with the reason when the name belongs to a plain session or a project |
| `scratch_kill` | — | `{killed}` — kills the scratch session only when it is ours; `false` when absent; refuses when the name belongs to something else |
| `new_window` | `session` | OK |
| `kill_window` | `target` | OK |

### Pane Operations
| Method | Params | Response |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `capture_pane` | `target`, `lines?` | `{output}` with ANSI colors |
| `send_keys` | `target`, `keys`, `literal` | OK |
| `paste_text` | `target`, `text` | OK. Real-terminal paste semantics via tmux `load-buffer` + `paste-buffer -p`: bracketed-paste markers (`\x1b[200~…\x1b[201~`) are added exactly when the pane app enabled mode `?2004`, so pasted newlines are not executed line by line. |
| `send_command` | `target`, `command` | OK |
| `pane_command` | `target` | `{command}` string |
| `resize_pane` | `target`, `cols`, `rows` | OK (auto-restores on disconnect) |
| `subscribe` | `target` | Starts polling, pushes `pane_output`. Side effect: stamps the session's `last_opened` timestamp (persisted to `session_usage.json`) for MRU sorting. |
| `unsubscribe` | `target` | Stops streaming |

### Filesystem
| Method | Params | Response |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `fs_cwd` | `session` | `{path}` |
| `fs_list` | `path`, `show_hidden?` | `{entries, path}` |
| `fs_stat` | `path` | FileStat object |
| `fs_read` | `path` | `{content}` (≤512KB) |
| `fs_write` | `path`, `content` | OK |
| `fs_mkdir` | `path` | OK |
| `fs_delete` | `path` | OK |
| `fs_rename` | `from`, `to` | OK |
| `fs_download` | `path` | `{name, data}` base64 (≤50MB). For inline preview; user-initiated downloads use `fs_download_url` + HTTP `/dl` streaming instead. |
| `fs_download_url` | `path`, `stream?` | `{url, name}` where `url` = `/dl?path=…&exp=…&sig=…`. Client GETs it on the same host (http:// for ws://, https:// for wss://) to stream the file; `/dl` honours `Range: bytes=N-` and `bytes=N-M` (206/416). Every 200/206 carries a strong `ETag` (`"<size hex>-<mtime ns hex>"`) and `Last-Modified` (exposed to cross-origin callers); `If-Range` naming that ETag or that date keeps the Range, any other value makes `/dl` ignore Range and answer the whole current file as 200 (RFC 7233), which is how a resuming client learns the file changed (board #305). `OPTIONS` on `/dl` is the CORS preflight a Tauri page sends for `If-Range`: 204, `Allow-Methods: GET`, `Allow-Headers: Range, If-Range`, `Allow-Private-Network: true` (a Chromium webview's Private Network Access asks in the same preflight), no signature check, no file access. A 416 also carries CORS headers, so a cross-origin client can read its `Content-Range`. HMAC-SHA256 over `dl:<path>:<exp>` (download) or `dl:stream:<path>:<exp>` (stream; URL carries `&stream=1`); `exp` is an absolute expiry: 60 s after minting for a download, 4 h with `stream: true` (a `<video>` re-requests the URL for the whole playback). `stream: true` is refused (invalid params, and 403 at `/dl`) unless the path is a video extension. No server-side size limit. |
| `fs_upload` | `path`, `data` | OK |
| `fs_convert` | `path`, `format?` | `{html}` (currently only pptx→html) |

### Git
| Method | Params | Response |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `git` | `subcmd`, `args[]`, `cwd?` | `{stdout, stderr, code}` |

Whitelisted subcmds: status, diff, log, show, branch, rev-parse, push, add, commit, restore.
Shell metacharacters rejected in args.

### Config / Preferences
| Method | Params | Response |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `set_socket` | `socket` | OK |
| `get_bookmarks` | — | `{bookmarks}` array |
| `save_bookmarks` | `bookmarks` | OK |
| `get_prefs` | — | Preferences JSON |
| `set_pref` | `key`, `value` | OK |

### Agent hooks (agent lifecycle telemetry)
The `agent_notifications_list` / `agent_notifications_mark_read` unread-inbox
RPCs and the `agent_notification` push retired 2026-09-01 with the old
notification-dot UI: the project room's auto-post + read cursor and the derived
status dots are the one notification language. The `agent_hooks_status` /
`agent_hooks_install` / `agent_hooks_remove` management RPCs retired
2026-09-20 (board #222): managed agents carry their hooks in the isolated
home's rendered config, so there was nothing left for a client to manage. The
hooks themselves remain — they feed telemetry, status derivation and the
auto-post. All of the retired methods answer METHOD_NOT_FOUND.

### Projects (desktop-only — method-not-found on servers without `state.db`)
A project is a workspace declaration; the tmux session is its projection. The
Projects section hides itself when these return -32601. See
[`docs/design-docs/features/projects.md`](../../design-docs/features/projects.md).

| Method | Params | Response |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `project_list` | `include_archived?` | `{projects: [{project, slots, live}]}` — the client subtracts these from `list_sessions` to get the untracked ones |
| `project_create` | `path`, `name?`, `session?`, `agent?` | The project (existing one for that path is returned, un-archived). `agent` seeds one settled agent window (`kiro`/`claude`/`codex`) |
| `project_adopt` | `session`, `name?` | `{project, slots}` — takes a live session's windows as the declaration |
| `project_up` | `id` | `{session, created_session, slots: [{window_name, status, error?}]}` |
| `project_down` | `id` | `{session, live: false}` — kills the session, keeps the declaration |
| `project_archive` | `id`, `archived?` | Hides/unhides without deleting |
| `project_rename` | `id`, `name` | `{id, name, session, session_renamed}` — renames the tmux session to `slug(name)` too. The chat room is recorded on the project so it does NOT move, the Board rows move transactionally to the new session key, and the previous session name stays reserved/resolving for agents already running with `TMM_PROJECT` (another project cannot reuse the alias) |
| `project_autostart` | `id`, `autostart?` | Flag only; no boot integration yet |
| `project_delete` | `id` | Forgets the project (slots cascade), closes the session, deletes `<path>/.tmm/agents/*` and its Board issues/note threads — the chat room and the user's files survive. Reached in the UI only through the recycle bin |
| `models_list` | `backend?` (default: the first entry of `backends_list`) | `{backend, models}` — model ids the backend accepts, asked of its own CLI (cached). `models` is `null` when it cannot be enumerated (claude, or codex without a `model_catalog_json` in the user's config), and the agent editor keeps free text |
| `backends_list` | — (no session, no gate: answered by every server, phone-hosted included) | `{backends: [{name, icon, color, efforts, input_modes, input_mode_toggle}]}` — the backends this server can spawn, in canonical order (first = the default an absent `backend` means). `icon` is the avatar path (`/assets/<name>.svg`), `color` the colour token NAME (`--backend-<name>`, values live in the client's app.css), `efforts` the reasoning levels the CLI accepts, `input_modes` whether a definition may choose `queue`/`steer` (board #245; absent on older servers = no choice), `input_mode_toggle` whether a RUNNING session can switch it (board #271: kiro's Ctrl+S; absent = no switch). The client keeps NO list of its own (source test `core/backends.source.test.ts`); on a pre-#130 server (method-not-found) it falls back to a frozen copy of this shape |

### Project Hub (desktop-only — the `tmm` CLI's surface)
One chat room per project on the bus (`proj:<session>`), agent status
declarations, derived agent states. Consumed by the `tmm` CLI (agents and
humans) and the desktop hub UI. See
[`docs/design-docs/features/tmm-cli.md`](../../design-docs/features/tmm-cli.md).

| Method | Params | Response |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `hub_post` | `session`, `body`, `from?` (default `human`), `status?`, `requires_reply?` | The stored message; `status=true` wraps the body as ambient `[tmm status working]` and never delivers mentions |
| `hub_log` | `session`, `since_ts?` (exclusive, epoch ms), `limit?` (default 100, cap 1000 PER PAGE — not a history horizon), `before_seq?` (exclusive; the page STRICTLY OLDER than that log position — 0/absent = the newest page), `around_seq?` (board #322: the page of THIS room around one of its messages — `limit/2` rows from it on, the rest before it; wins over `before_seq`/`since_ts` and adds `newer_more`: newer rows exist, so the page is not the tail) | `{messages: […], has_more, head_seq, oldest_seq?}` — oldest first; archived messages are filtered out. Nothing is ever pruned from a room, so `before_seq` = `oldest_seq` of the page you hold is the lazy-load step backwards. `has_more` is measured (the store is asked for one row more), so "that is the whole conversation" is distinguishable from "your page ended exactly at the limit". `oldest_seq` is the cursor for the next page back: a SURVIVING row's seq when the page has one, else the RAW page's oldest seq — a page can lose every row to the archive/`since_ts` filters, and `has_more: true` with no cursor would stop scroll-up dead at a hidden run. `seq` is globally monotonic across ALL rooms (one AUTOINCREMENT log), so gaps inside one room's sequence are normal — treat it as an opaque cursor, never as a count of what is missing. On a `since_ts` query `has_more` changes meaning: true iff rows NEWER than `since_ts` remain behind this page (the raw page did not reach back to the cursor) — the client then walks `before_seq` pages until one does, so a room that gained more than a page while unwatched has no hole (2026-09-03) |
| `hub_rooms` | — (the one hub method with no `session`) | `{rooms: {"<room>": ts_ms}}` — newest message per room, one grouped query; orders the project sidebar by conversation |
| `hub_unread` | `{rooms: {"<room>": {seq} \| {ts}}}` — the reader's watermark per room (last read seq, or a legacy ts); no `session`, like `hub_rooms` | `{rooms: {"<room>": {count, first_seq, last_seq}}}` — every row above the watermark is read, then the ONE news rule (`rooms::news_kind`, TS twin `newsKind`, shared case table) keeps replies, status notes and finished lines (a board move to review/done, `[tmm done]`) and drops own words and other narration; archived rows excluded; a room with none is ABSENT. At most 256 rooms per call (board #322). The watermark is the LATER of the server's read mark (`hub_read`) and the client's (a legacy ts mark resolved to the room's seq first); a client mark past the room's newest seq/ts is impossible and dropped at the door. The answer also carries `marks: {"<room>": {seq, ts}}` — the PERSISTED server mark of every asked room that has one, never the effective max (board #334) |
| `hub_read` | `{rooms: {"<room>": {seq} \| {ts}}}` — the human read these rooms; no `session` | `{rooms: {"<room>": {seq, ts}}}` — the persisted marks, the client's ACK. The server resolves each mark to a real message (a seq clamped to the room's newest, a legacy ts to the newest message at or before it; the stored ts is that message's) and only moves it forward. A room with no messages, or an empty mark, writes nothing and is absent. Bootstrap: the v31 migration seeded every room that already had messages read to its head; a room born after the upgrade has no mark until a client reads it, so all its messages count. One mark per room per server (one human reader); `tmm` never calls it. At most 256 rooms (board #334) |
| `hub_search` | `session`, `grep[]` (non-empty term list; any-match, substring, ASCII-case-insensitive, against body AND sender), `global?` (bool: search EVERY room, not just this project's — `session` is still required, it names the caller), `limit?` (default 50, cap 500) | `{messages: […]}` — the newest `limit` hits, oldest first; each message carries its `room`, which is what makes a `global` answer readable. Archived messages are filtered out per room, same one-way mirror as `hub_log`. `hub_log` pages, this FINDS — no cursors, a narrower `grep` is how you dig deeper |
| `hub_msg_archive` | `session`, `ids[]` | `{archived: n}` — HIDES messages (they stay in the room's store — state.db `hub_msgs` — so `hub_log` filters them out on the way). Reversible, so no confirmation. Bodies are looked up by exact id, so a message the user scrolled back to is as archivable as a fresh one |
| `hub_msg_restore` | `session`, `ids[]` | `{restored: n}` — take them back out of the archive |
| `hub_msg_purge` | `session`, `ids[]` | `{deleted: n}` — forgets them for good: deletes from `hub_msgs` first, then drops the archive rows |
| `hub_archive` | `session` | `{messages: [{id, ts, from, body, archived_at}]}` — what is hidden, newest first; each row carries its own copy of the message |
| `hub_command` | `session`, `agent` (window name or `all`), `text` (must start with `/`), `from?` (the sending agent, `tmm send`; absent = `human`, the composer — board #274: the room line is posted under it, `all` skips it, and `agent == from` is refused) | `{sent: [names], command}` — types the text VERBATIM into the managed agent's pane (no stamp, no sender): slash commands are read by the CLI, not the model. Where the backend declares the command's prompt-hook echo, a receipt row carrying the room line's id is recorded first, so that echo marks the command delivered (board #264). Recorded in the room as a `[tmm] ` lifecycle line |
| `hub_agents` | `session` | `{agents: [{window, name, command, agent, managed, state, detail, since, vitals, input_mode, wake}]}` — `vitals` is `{model, context_pct, effort, branch}` SNIFFED from the last lines of a managed agent's pane (a CLI's live state has no API): every field may be null, and `vitals` itself is null when nothing could be read. `wake` is the soonest pending wake whose body addresses this agent (`@name` or `@all`), `{due_at, from, more}`, else null (board #275). `input_mode` is `queue`/`steer`, the mode the session RUNS (board #271: read off the pane, else its last reading in the same pane, else the launch recipe's start mode); null for a backend without the choice or an unmanaged window |
| `hub_wake_add` | `session`, `body`, `due` (unix seconds), `from?` (absent = `human`) | the stored wake `{id, session, sender, body, due_at, created_at}` — schedules `body` to be posted as `from` at `due` and delivered like a line sent then, prefixed `[wake] ` (board #275). Refused (invalid params): no `@` recipient, a `/command`, `due` already past or more than 7 days ahead, 50 already pending in the project |
| `hub_wake_list` | `session`, `all?` | `{wakes: [wake]}` — pending, soonest first; `all` = every project's |
| `hub_wake_cancel` | `session`, `id`, `by?` (absent = `human`) | `{id, cancelled: true}` — only the wake's scheduler or `human`; a wake of another project, or one already fired, is not found |
| `hub_activity` | `session`, `since_ts?`, `limit?` (default 600, hard cap 1000 PER PAGE — not a history horizon), `before_ts?` + `before_id?` (exclusive cursor; the page strictly OLDER than it) | `{events: […], has_more, oldest: {ts, id}?, total, first_ts}` — oldest first; durable telemetry rows (tool calls, prompts, receipts, warns) the feed folds into tool lanes. The log is COMPLETE (nothing is pruned), so the read is the bounded half: pass `oldest` straight back as `before_ts`/`before_id` to walk as far back as the log goes. The cursor needs BOTH halves — a busy turn writes several events inside one millisecond; `before_id` omitted means "older than that whole millisecond" (always progresses, may skip same-ms siblings). `total`/`first_ts` describe what the server holds, for a "N of M loaded" affordance. A `prompt` event carries `via: app|local`. Since v24 (board #249) `prompt` and `warn` events carry `deliveries?: {id, msg?}[]` — the delivery rows the echo settled or the warn reported, `id` the row (the one correlation key), `msg` the chat message it carries where one exists; absent when none. A warn whose row a later echo names is retracted by the client |
| `hub_spawn` | `session`, `agent` (registry name), `brief?`, `by?` (spawning agent, empty = human) | `{window_name, pane}` — materializes an isolated home and opens the session if needed; the stamped first prompt names `by`, establishing the final-reply edge |
| `hub_agent_interrupt` | `session`, `agent` | `{ok}` — resets the derived state FIRST (`record_interrupt`), then types the named `Escape` key into the pane; posts `[tmm] interrupted <name>` |
| `hub_agent_input_mode` | `session`, `agent`, `mode` (`queue`\|`steer`) | `{agent, mode, changed}` — switches a running session's mode for THIS session with the CLI's live toggle (board #271; kiro's named key `C-s`), under the window's delivery lock (the one a delivery reads the mode under) and then the pane's send lock: `changed: false` and nothing typed when it already runs `mode`; otherwise one key, then success only once the pane shows `mode` (else an internal error, no second key). Posts `[tmm] switched <agent> — <mode> mode (this session)` when it changed (verb `switched` in the feed's one lifecycle grammar). The registry, `launch.json` and the CLI's config are untouched; a restart starts from the configured mode. Invalid params: a mode other than queue/steer, an agent this app did not start, a backend without a live switch |
| `hub_agent_stop` | `session`, `agent` | `{stopped}` — kills the window, keeps the slot (a stopped agent restarts via restart, or via `project_up` with the rest of the workspace) |
| `hub_agent_restart` | `session`, `agent` | `{restarted, resumed}` — refreshes the agent's materials, then replays the launch recipe of THIS slot only (full identity: env, `--agent`, model in config) and resumes its recorded conversation; other stopped agents in the project are not touched (#210). `resumed: false` = the slot was not restorable and a fresh resume spawn ran instead |
| `hub_agent_remove` | `session`, `agent` | `{ok}` — ejects: kills the window, DROPS the slot, deletes the isolated home; refuses only when nothing of the agent is left |
| `hub_board_list` | `session` | `{issues: […], statuses}` — the project task board, four fixed columns (`todo/doing/review/done`); each issue carries a note COUNT. Public `id`/`#N` is a session-local sequence: every project's first issue is `#1`, deletes leave gaps, and numbers are never reused. Every single-issue operation resolves `session + id`; the database-wide row key remains internal for note FKs only |
| `hub_board_counts` | — (no `session`, like `hub_rooms`) | `{counts: {"<session>": {todo, doing, review, done, total}}}` — issue counts for EVERY board in one grouped read; the four statuses are zero-filled server-side, `total` is explicit, and a project with an empty board is ABSENT (absence = hide) |
| `hub_board_get` | `session`, `id` | The issue with its full `notes` thread and server-computed `editable` (`true` only while unassigned and before any Agent save/note activity) |
| `hub_board_save` | `session`, `id?`, `title?`, `body?`, `status?`, `assignee?`, `who?` | Create (no id) or PATCH (id + only the changed fields — COALESCE, so a `move` cannot erase a body edited meanwhile). Once assigned or touched by an Agent, title/body are immutable server-side; workflow fields remain patchable. `{ok, id}` |
| `hub_board_note` | `session`, `id`, `body`, `who?` | Appends to the issue's own thread, bumps `updated_at` |
| `hub_board_delete` | `session`, `id` | `{ok}` — deletes the issue and cascades its notes |

### Registry, skills & MCP defs (desktop-only)
Central definitions that `spawn` materializes into isolated agent homes. The
skill store is app-owned files under `<state dir>/skills/<name>/`; three
built-ins (`tmm-cli`, `mem`, `mcp-cli`) ship inside the binary and reseed at
server start (`source = "builtin"`; save/delete refuse their names).

| Method | Params | Response |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `registry_list` | — | `{agents: [{name, backend, model, effort, input_mode, system, skills, mcp}]}` (the `can_hire` flag was retired 2026-09-26; `input_mode` is `queue`\|`steer`, v25) |
| `registry_save` | `def` | Validates backend, model id (against the backend's own CLI), effort enum and `input_mode` (`queue` default when absent; `steer` only where `backends_list` says `input_modes`) |
| `registry_delete` | `name` | OK |
| `global_prompt_get` | — | `{text, path, max_bytes}` — the app-wide agent instructions (`<config>/AGENTS.md`), prepended to every managed agent's system prompt at spawn |
| `global_prompt_set` | `text` | `{ok, bytes}`; empty text deletes the file; > 24 KB rejected |
| `skills_list` | — | `{skills: [{name, source, description, synced_at}]}` |
| `skills_save` | `name`, `source`, `description?` | Imports/re-syncs the files from `source` (abs dir, github url, or `builtin`) |
| `skills_import` | `url` (or abs dir) | `{imported: [names]}` — walks the fetched tree for EVERY dir holding a SKILL.md (claude plugins/marketplaces work as-is); each row's source points at its own subdir; frontmatter names, built-in names skipped |
| `skills_read` | `name` | `{markdown}` — the managed SKILL.md |
| `skills_files` | `name` | `{files: [{path, size}]}` — every managed file of the skill |
| `skills_file` | `name`, `path` | `{content}` — 256 KB cap, text only, path escapes rejected |
| `skills_refresh` | `name` | Re-syncs from the recorded source (builtin = the running build) |
| `skills_delete` | `name` | OK (refused for built-ins) |
| `mcp_list` / `mcp_save` / `mcp_delete` | `name`, `def?` | Central MCP server defs; materialized into each backend's native config at spawn |

### Team (desktop-only — method-not-found on servers without the bus)
All chat operations are scoped to a team `room`; `team_status` / `team_teams`
are team-agnostic. The Team tab hides itself when these return -32601.

| Method | Params | Response |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `team_status` | — | `{available, teams, system_prompt, …}` |
| `team_teams` | — | Team list (room, workspace, agents) |
| `team_start_team` | `workspace`, `template?` | Starts a team for the workspace; returns its descriptor |
| `team_close_team` | `room` | OK |
