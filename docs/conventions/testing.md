# Testing Conventions

Frontend tests and repository development-script tests run with `npm test`
(`node --test`, no framework, no tmux needed). Rust tests: `cd src-tauri && cargo test -- --test-threads=1`
(needs a running tmux). This file governs the frontend side.

Client-mount tests require Node `^22.22.2 || ^24.15.0 || >=26.0.0`
(jsdom 30's engine requirement; board #115, 2026-09-09). `node --test`
remains the only runner. Install with real npm from `package-lock.json`;
see [development.md](development.md#node-and-package-installation).

## Three Test Tiers

### 1. Unit tests — `<module>.test.ts`

One test file per module, colocated, named EXACTLY after the module it
tests (`ws.test.ts` tests `ws.ts`; `agent-notifications.test.ts` tests
`agent-notifications.svelte.ts`). They import the module and test
behavior. If a module is worth extracting, its invariants are worth
pinning here.

Runes modules (`*.svelte.ts`) are testable in node with the shim:

```js
globalThis.$state = value => value;
```

### 2. Component Contracts: Source and Rendered Markup

`<Component>.source.test.ts` reads source and asserts deliberate wiring or
CSS contracts: which query a template calls, which navigation states exist,
or which cell owns overflow. These assertions do not execute handlers.

- Named after the component, colocated (`Terminal.source.test.ts` next
  to `Terminal.svelte`; `App.source.test.ts` next to `src/App.svelte`).
- One component per file. A cross-component contract gets one file per
  component, each asserting that component's half.
- When one fails after an intentional change, update the assertion —
  the failure means the change must be deliberate, not that it's wrong.
- Prefer upgrading to a real unit test whenever the logic can move into
  an importable module — source regexes are a last resort, and each one
  should explain WHY the invariant matters.

`<Component>.render.ts` compiles the real component through Vite SSR and
asserts its emitted markup (`Board.render.ts` was the first, as
`Board.render.test.ts`). A suite is a plain module of `test()` calls beside
its component that loads it through the ONE warm harness —
`const h = await renderHarness()` from `src/lib/test/ssr.ts`, then
`h.load('/src/lib/hub/X.svelte')`, `h.render`, `h.fragment(html)` — and it is
collected by `src/lib/test/render.test.ts`, the tier's single process. Every
suite runs under `{ timeout: RENDER_TIMEOUT_MS }`; the harness installs the
one browser-like environment (a jsdom window), so a suite sets no globals
and closes nothing. Prefer it over source regexes for rendered branches and
attributes. SSR does not run client effects or event handlers; it cannot
establish timing, listener order or reactive behavior after a click.

**The render tier is one process with a measured budget** (board #178, lead
2026-09-12: in three review runs every render test — seven of them — timed
out at 60 s together while reruns passed; passing runs showed 35–42 s each).
Measured on this host (16 cores, load ~20) a render process paid, before its
one test could start: import jsdom 1.1 s CPU, import vite 0.3 s,
createServer 0.7–0.9 s, the component graph 1.9–2.6 s (56 of Feed's 80
modules are the svelte runtime, recompiled identically in every process),
render + parse 0.25 s — 5.1 s CPU per file, 44 s CPU for seven files that
ran 2.5–5.4 s alone and 8 s inside the parallel suite; a host at load 54
(leaked headless browsers) stretched that to 35–42 s, and 60 s was 1.5× the
typical, not a budget. The tier is now one process behind one warm server:
the fixed cost is paid once at import, outside any test's timer, and each
suite's timer sees only its own component files. After: 5.9 s wall / 9.8 s
CPU for the whole tier alone; inside the suite the slowest suites are Drawer
3.4 s (xterm through `noExternal`) and Board 2.6 s, the rest 0.04–0.5 s.
`RENDER_TYPICAL_MS` (4 s, that slowest typical) and `RENDER_TIMEOUT_MS`
(20 s, 5× it; the rule is ≥ 3×) are the harness's contract;
`harness.source.test.ts` pins the ratio, that no `*.render.test.ts` process
creeps back, that every `*.render.ts` is on the collector's list, uses the
harness, sets no literal timeout and reaches for neither vite nor jsdom.

**A test harness holds no fixed port** (board #177, lead 2026-09-12). Several
agents share this host, so two `npm test` runs at once — the launch checkout
and a worktree — are normal, not a mistake. They collided: every render and
mount case in one run timed out at 60 s behind "WebSocket server error: Port
24678 is already in use", and a rerun minutes later was green. Vite 6's
`createServer` in middleware mode opens its OWN http server for the HMR
websocket on the fixed default 24678 even with `server.hmr: false` — that
flag only stops the update messages; `server.ws: false` is what opens no
socket (Vite 6.4.2, `if (config.server.ws === false)`). The render tier
therefore obtains its one server from the ONE helper, `src/lib/test/ssr.ts`
(`ssrServer({ cacheDir, … })`: middleware mode, `hmr: false`, `ws: false`,
no port), and the mount tier builds without serving.
`src/lib/test/harness.source.test.ts` pins both and that `createServer(`
appears nowhere else under `src/` or `scripts/`. Proof: two concurrent
`npm test` runs on the fix are both green with 24678 never bound; with
`ws: false` removed the guard fails and a single render test binds the port.

### 3. Client Behavior: `<Component>.mount.test.ts`

Board #115 adds one helper, `src/lib/test/mount.ts`, for executing the real
Svelte client component under `node --test`. `compileMount(component,
mockedModules)` builds once; its `mount(context, options)` creates a fresh
jsdom window for each scenario. Module implementations in `options.modules`
match the declared module order. Keep fixtures and assertions beside the
component, not in a general mock framework.

- Compile client output with browser export conditions, not `ssrLoadModule`.
  The component and `mount`/`tick`/`flushSync`/`unmount` share one Svelte runtime.
- Execute only the trusted test bundle in `getInternalVMContext()` with
  `runScripts: outside-only`. Never assign `global.window` in Node or allow
  document scripts/resources to execute.
- Mock the RPC boundary with explicit responses or controlled promises.
  Replies are JSON-cloned into the client realm. Unknown exports, network
  calls and jsdom errors fail the fixture even if the component catches them.
- Compile before enabling Node's mock clock. `advance(ms)` advances timers;
  `flush()` settles Svelte and the queued rAF callbacks. Do not sleep for
  timing assertions or run active mounts concurrently in one test process.
- Always close the mount in `finally`: unmount, clear frames, close the
  window and reset timers. Cleanup is also registered with the test context.
  Fresh localStorage and a new realm prevent one scenario seeding the next.
- Vite uses `configFile:false`, `write:false` and a unique temporary
  `cacheDir`, removed after compilation. No listener, optimizer, live
  `node_modules/.vite`, public assets or project `dist` is involved.
- Heavy packages (`pdfjs-dist`, Mermaid, highlight.js, KaTeX and xterm)
  are excluded at the test-build boundary; bare lazy package imports stay
  deferred. Attempting to use them fails explicitly. Never modify production
  components to make a fixture cheaper.

The initial proof is one `Hub.mount.test.ts` characterization: actual card
clicks select the recipient, defer its menu until 260ms, cancel a pending
menu when another card is clicked, and release the push subscription on
unmount. Three repeats of this same scenario reuse the bundle but not the DOM.
Its negative control removed the per-card guard and failed with `bob` where
the clicked recipient was `alice`.

**Scope:** this tier proves synthetic DOM event wiring, closures, reactive
updates, controlled async ordering, timers and cleanup. It does not prove
layout, sticky geometry, paint, browser navigation, native selection/IME,
clipboard/user activation or renderer output. jsdom has no layout engine;
the inert ResizeObserver and matchMedia defaults are environment fixtures,
not measured geometry. Use real Chromium for those claims.

**Measured cost** (2026-09-09, Node 22.23.2, Svelte 5.53.5, Vite 6.4.1,
jsdom 30.0.1, canonical npm lock): the initial all-dependency bundle took
21.38s with observed RSS around 1.4 GiB. Excluding heavy packages gave five
fresh-process runs at 7.56-7.88s wall time, including 5.13-5.45s compilation;
additional fresh-DOM repeats took 76-87ms, with 388-413 MiB peak RSS on Linux.
Each process had a fresh Vite cache; the OS page cache was not flushed.
Keep added cold-test cost within 10s and additional bundled scenarios below
500ms; remeasure before expanding the tier. These are budget evidence, not
flaky wall-clock assertions in the test.

## Rules

- New module → its `<module>.test.ts` lands in the same commit.
- Tests are TypeScript (`.test.ts`) — node executes them natively via
  type stripping, and `npm run check` verifies test code against the
  typed modules it exercises. Deliberately-partial test doubles are cast
  once at the boundary (`as unknown as X`) with a comment; don't build
  full fakes just to satisfy the checker.
- No test file without a clear subject; no subject with two test files of
  the same kind. A component may have source, SSR render and client-mount
  files: structure, emitted markup and executing behavior are different
  contracts. Use the cheapest tier that actually proves the claim.
- Every regression fix starts with a failing test that reproduces it.
- Rust tests never see the operator's `~/.config/tmux-mobile`. Under
  `cfg(test)` the lib's `config::dirs_next()` is ONE empty temp directory
  per test process (`/tmp/tmm-config-test-<pid>`), so every
  `config_dir()` consumer (config.toml, AGENTS.md, the hooks helper,
  skills-cache, the default state.db) reads defaults and writes scratch;
  a test cannot forget to isolate itself. Integration test crates build
  the lib without `cfg(test)` and point `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` — the app's one
  config-dir override — at a temp dir once per process
  (`isolate_config_dir` in `tests/concurrent_rpc.rs`). A test that WRITES
  a config file uses its own subdirectory, never the shared root. Reason:
  board #216 (2026-09-20) — the live `kiro_engine = "v3"` turned three
  v2-default assertions red on every branch, and earlier the spawn tests
  had pointed the whole process at the real `state.db`.
- Every Rust test that creates a tmux session or a scratch directory names
  it for its process: `tmux::Scratch::new(tag)` in the lib (sessions
  `tmm-test-<tag>-<pid>-<part>`, directory `<temp>/tmm-test-<tag>-<pid>`),
  `TestSession` in `main.rs` (`_tmux_mobile_test_<pid>_<test>`), a pid or
  uuid suffix elsewhere. The guard is taken before anything exists and kills
  and removes on drop, also on panic. Every cargo run on the host shares one
  tmux server and one temp dir, so a fixed name let a second run kill,
  reuse or delete the first run's session or directory mid-test, and a
  leaked `tmm-test-share-a` was auto-adopted by the live server as a
  project. Reason: board #265 (t06 flaked during #264) and #268 (the lib
  tests #265 missed); the guard rule is #251.

## Current source-contract inventory

| File | Pins |
|------|------|
| `src/App.source.test.ts` | notification refresh on every connect path; terminal nav/page-layer structure |
| `projects/Projects.source.test.ts` | Terminal Projects consumes the same conversation-first update clock/formatter as Chat |
| `sessions/Sessions.source.test.ts` | notification-state import wiring |
| `sessions/PanePicker.source.test.ts` | Team-dot suppression in the picker; it is a fixed popover placed from its opener with the shared dismissal set |
| `terminal/Terminal.source.test.ts` | Terminal chrome uses only Team-filtered queries |
| `team/Team.source.test.ts` | roster chip wrap/overflow CSS contract; the composer's Enter rule; the team switcher is the shared ContextMenu and names teams by project |
| `team/TeamTemplates.source.test.ts` | the phone's template picker is `ui/Select`, never a hand-rolled panel |
| `ui/tokens.source.test.ts` | one type scale: no raw px font-size outside the listed exceptions |
| `ui/confirm.source.test.ts` | every destructive verb goes through the shared confirmation |
| `hub/Hub.source.test.ts` | room/paging/send coordination, the narrow component boundaries and capture-listener order |
| `hub/Feed.source.test.ts` | a tool-lane row is one line (`nowrap`, never `pre`), the argument is never truncated (the lane pans instead), the row cap stays expressed in rows, and reading geometry stays in the one Feed |
| `ui/sidebar.source.test.ts` | one sidebar box: a section header takes its padding and type from `.side-h`, and `.side-h`/`.side-row` keep the same 10px inset |
| `ui/statusdot.source.test.ts` | the running cue: `--status-sleep` stays achromatic, `.live-dot` is defined once in app.css (halo + `dot-breathe` scale, never an opacity fade) and stills under reduced motion, and no component re-implements it |
| `app/preferences.source.test.ts` | Settings embeds the real AgentsPage (never a copy), the category exists only where Agents is not a page, back peels the embedded page first, one head at a time |
| `files/Files.source.test.ts` | back retraces the user's steps; drag-drop uploads into the current directory; markdown preview goes through the ONE safe renderer (never a bare `marked.parse`); heavy preview libraries load on first use; the lined preview is capped |
| `files/DirPicker.source.test.ts` | ONE directory picker under `src/lib` (rule 6); the newest listing wins; it can create the folder it picks |
| `hub/Board.source.test.ts` | the issue detail is a draft (explicit save, guarded exits), assignment is one dispatch, the layout hierarchy, sidebar order, notes as a timeline, columns scroll alone |
| `system/system.source.test.ts` | the vitals corner takes its transport by injection, polls low-frequency and stops while hidden, fails soft, wears tokens |
| `ui/totail.source.test.ts` | the to-tail atoms live in app.css once; both records wear the shared class |
| `ui/motion.source.test.ts` | the micro-motion vocabulary (motion.md): `.chev`/`.flip`, the three intro keyframes and `.state-ctl` live once in app.css on the two tempo tokens and still under reduced motion; `ui/motion.ts` mirrors the tokens; no component redefines an atom, imports `svelte/transition`, uses `animate:flip` without `moveMs()`, or runs an `infinite` loop without a reduced-motion rule |
| `ui/indicator.test.ts`, `ui/hover.test.ts` | the sliding indicator's box→variables mapping and the hover card's dwell/hop timing (pure halves of `ui/indicator.ts` / `ui/hover.ts`) |
| `ui/popover.source.test.ts` | every fixed popover (Select, ContextMenu, PanePicker) dismisses on an outside ancestor scroll but never on its own list scrolling |
